      "It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  \t\n",
      "Great movie!  \t\n",
      "Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  \n",
      "The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  \n",
      "I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \n",
      "But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  \n",
      "The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  \t\n",
      "It is shameful.  \n",
      "In short, don't bother with this movie.  \t\n",

      "His performance is simply genius.  \t\n",
      "In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  \n",
      "I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  \n",
      "It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  \n",
      "Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \n",
      "Exceptionally bad!  \n",
      "She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  \n",
      "This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  \n",

      "Really awful.  \n",
      "His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  \n",
      "I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \t\n",
      "One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  \n",
      "All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  \n",
      "It just blew.  \n",
      "Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  \t\n",
      "Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t\n",
      "The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \t\n",
      "The kids are annoying.  \n",
      "About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  \n",
      "The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  \n",
      "And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \n",
      "Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \t\n",
      "I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \t\n",
