For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative. We will also rate the importance of each feature on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: 0.022, -0.003, 0.062
Instances with negative changes in A: -0.129, -0.110, -0.049, -0.144, -0.062, -0.095, -0.156, -0.088, -0.031, -0.034
From the dataset, it seems that negative changes in A are more correlated with a decrease in the output (-1) compared to positive changes in A, which have a mix of both positive and negative changes in the output (0 and -1). This suggests that negative changes in A have a stronger influence on the output.

b. Importance rating: 70
Based on the analysis, feature A seems to have a moderate importance (rating of 70) in determining the output. Negative changes in A have a stronger correlation with a decrease in the output compared to positive changes.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.105, 0.151, 0.046, -0.103, 0.063, 0.068, 0.024

Positive changes in B seem to have a mix of both positive and negative changes in the output, while negative changes in B are more correlated with a decrease in the output.

b. Importance rating: 60
Based on the analysis, feature B has a moderate importance (rating of 60) in determining the output. Negative changes in B have a slightly stronger correlation with a decrease in the output compared to positive changes.

Based on the analysis, feature L has a relatively lower importance (rating of 50) in determining the output. There is no clear correlation between changes in L and the output.

13. Feature M:
a. Instances with positive changes in M: 0.152, -0.134, -0.057, 0.005, -0.008, 0.114, -0.130, 0.036, -0.135, 0.015, 0.092, 0.201, -0.217
Instances with negative changes in M: 0.152, -0.134, -0.057, 0.005, -0.008, 0.114, -0.130, 0.036, -0.135, 0.015, 0.092, 0.201, -0.217
