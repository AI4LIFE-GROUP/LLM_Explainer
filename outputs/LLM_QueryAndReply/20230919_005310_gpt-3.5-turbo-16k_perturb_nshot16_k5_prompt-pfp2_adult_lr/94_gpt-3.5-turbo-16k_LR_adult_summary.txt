For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.

Therefore, the change in feature 'K' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. Considering both positive and negative correlations, the importance of feature 'K' in determining the output is moderate. We can rate its importance as 50.

12. Analyzing feature 'L':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'L' (-0.006, -0.077, 0.089, 0.008, 0.118, 0.094, 0.052, 0.097, 0.155, -0.010, -0.017, -0.152, -0.138, 0.198, -0.012, -0.042) have mixed effects on the output. Instances with negative changes in feature 'L' (-0.006, -0.077, 0.089, 0.008, 0.118, 0.094, 0.052, 0.097, 0.155, -0.010, -0.017, -0.152, -0.138, 0.198, -0.012, -0.042) also have mixed effects on the output. Therefore, the change in feature 'L' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. Considering both positive and negative correlations, the importance of feature 'L' in determining the output is moderate. We can rate its importance as 50.

13. Analyzing feature 'M':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'M' (-0.026, 0.003, 0.126, -0.048, 0.025, 0.074, -0.044, 0.072, -0.029, 0.088, -0.074, 0.124, 0.037, -0.063, -0.012, -0.078) have mixed effects on the output. Instances with negative changes in feature 'M' (-0.026, 0.003, 0.126, -0.048, 0.025, 0.074, -0.044, 0.072, -0.029, 0.088, -0.074, 0.124, 0.037, -0.063, -0.012, -0.078) also have mixed effects on the output. Therefore, the change in feature 'M' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. Considering both positive and negative correlations, the importance of feature 'M' in determining the output is moderate. We can rate its importance as 50.

Based on the analysis of each feature, the rank of features from 'A' to 'M' in terms of importance in determining the output is as follows: D > A = B = C = E = F = G = H = I = J = K = L = M.

The final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' is: D > A = B = C = E = F = G = H = I = J = K = L = M.
