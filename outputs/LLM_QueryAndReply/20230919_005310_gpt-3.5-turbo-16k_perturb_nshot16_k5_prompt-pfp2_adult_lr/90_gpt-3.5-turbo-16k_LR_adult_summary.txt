For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, we will compare instances where the changes in each feature are positive to instances where the changes are negative. We will also consider the change in output corresponding to each change in feature.

1. Analyzing feature 'A':
a. Instances with positive changes in 'A': 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.019, B: -0.152, C: 0.018, D: 0.360, E: 0.077, F: 0.018, G: 0.133, H: -0.072, I: 0.150, J: -0.069, K: 0.038, L: 0.089, M: -0.012 
   - Change in Output: 0

   Instances with negative changes in 'A':
   - Change in Input: A: -0.018, B: 0.122, C: 0.084, D: -0.360, E: -0.003, F: -0.088, G: -0.142, H: -0.132, I: 0.056, J: 0.141, K: -0.114, L: -0.095, M: -0.082 
   - Change in Output: -1

   The instances with positive changes in 'A' resulted in no change in the output, while the instances with negative changes in 'A' resulted in a decrease in the output. This suggests that negative changes in 'A' have a stronger correlation with a decrease in the output compared to positive changes.

   - Change in Output: -1

   The instances with positive changes in 'B' resulted in no change in the output, while the instances with negative changes in 'B' resulted in a decrease in the output. This suggests that negative changes in 'B' have a stronger correlation with a decrease in the output compared to positive changes.
