For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where change in A is positive: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: 0.139, C: -0.153, D: 0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.283, B: -0.077, C: 0.016, D: 0.179 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.175, B: -0.043, C: -0.195, D: 0.265 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.219, B: -0.241, C: -0.161, D: 0.184 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.274, B: -0.092, C: -0.239, D: 0.023 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.220, B: -0.052, C: -0.146, D: 0.191 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.039, C: -0.011, D: 0.121 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.179, B: -0.031, C: -0.126, D: 0.350 

b. Instances where change in A is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.219, B: 0.228, C: 0.131, D: -0.113 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.138, B: 0.220, C: 0.252, D: -0.075 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.231, B: 0.200, C: 0.110, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.243, B: 0.205, C: 0.127, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.300, B: 0.105, C: 0.202, D: 0.230 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.312, B: 0.163, C: 0.106, D: 0.072 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.190, B: 0.275, C: 0.137, D: -0.014 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.234, B: 0.134, C: 0.252, D: 0.087 

From the above analysis, we can observe that when the change in feature A is positive, the change in output is consistently -1. On the other hand, when the change in feature A is negative, the change in output is consistently 0. This indicates a strong negative correlation between feature A and the output. 

To rate the importance of feature A in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a score on a scale of 0-100. Since both positive and negative correlations are equally important, we can assign a score of 50 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature A in determining the output is 50.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where change in B is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: 0.139, C: -0.153, D: 0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.219, B: 0.228, C: 0.131, D: -0.113 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.138, B: 0.220, C: 0.252, D: -0.075 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.231, B: 0.200, C: 0.110, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.219, B: -0.241, C: -0.161, D: 0.184 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.300, B: 0.105, C: 0.202, D: 0.230 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.312, B: 0.163, C: 0.106, D: 0.072 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.234, B: 0.134, C: 0.252, D: 0.087 

b. Instances where change in B is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.283, B: -0.077, C: 0.016, D: 0.179 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.175, B: -0.043, C: -0.195, D: 0.265 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.274, B: -0.092, C: -0.239, D: 0.023 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.220, B: -0.052, C: -0.146, D: 0.191 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.039, C: -0.011, D: 0.121 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.179, B: -0.031, C: -0.126, D: 0.350 

From the above analysis, we can observe that when the change in feature B is positive, the change in output is consistently 0. On the other hand, when the change in feature B is negative, the change in output is consistently -1. This indicates a strong negative correlation between feature B and the output. 

To rate the importance of feature B in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a score on a scale of 0-100. Since both positive and negative correlations are equally important, we can assign a score of 50 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature B in determining the output is 50.

Based on the analysis of features A and B, we can position them in a running rank:
AB

Moving on to feature C:
a. Instances where change in C is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.219, B: 0.228, C: 0.131, D: -0.113 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.138, B: 0.220, C: 0.252, D: -0.075

   - Change in Input: A: -0.234, B: 0.134, C: 0.252, D: 0.087 

b. Instances where change in C is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: 0.139, C: -0.153, D: 0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.283, B: -0.077, C: 0.016, D: 0.179 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.175, B: -0.043, C: -0.195, D: 0.265 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.231, B: 0.200, C: 0.110, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.243, B: 0.205, C: 0.127, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.039, C: -0.011, D: 0.121 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.179, B: -0.031, C: -0.126, D: 0.350 

From the above analysis, we can observe that when the change in feature C is positive, the change in output is consistently 0. On the other hand, when the change in feature C is negative, the change in output is consistently -1. This indicates a strong negative correlation between feature C and the output. 

To rate the importance of feature C in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a score on a scale of 0-100. Since both positive and negative correlations are equally important, we can assign a score of 50 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature C in determining the output is 50.

Based on the analysis of features A, B, and C, we can position them in a running rank:
ABC

Finally, let's analyze feature D:
a. Instances where change in D is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.283, B: -0.077, C: 0.016, D: 0.179 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.231, B: 0.200, C: 0.110, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.219, B: -0.241, C: -0.161, D: 0.184 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.300, B: 0.105, C: 0.202, D: 0.230 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.039, C: -0.011, D: 0.121 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.220, B: -0.052, C: -0.146, D: 0.191 

b. Instances where change in D is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: 0.139, C: -0.153, D: 0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.219, B: 0.228, C: 0.131, D: -0.113 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.138, B: 0.220, C: 0.252, D: -0.075 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.231, B: 0.200, C: 0.110, D: -0.069 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.312, B: 0.163, C: 0.106, D: 0.072 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.234, B: 0.134, C: 0.252, D: 0.087 

From the above analysis, we can observe that when the change in feature D is positive, the change in output is consistently 0. On the other hand, when the change in feature D is negative, the change in output is consistently -1. This indicates a strong negative correlation between feature D and the output. 

To rate the importance of feature D in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a score on a scale of 0-100. Since both positive and negative correlations are equally important, we can assign a score of 50 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature D in determining the output is 50.

Based on the analysis of features A, B, C, and D, we can position them in a running rank:
ABCD

The final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' is ABCD.
