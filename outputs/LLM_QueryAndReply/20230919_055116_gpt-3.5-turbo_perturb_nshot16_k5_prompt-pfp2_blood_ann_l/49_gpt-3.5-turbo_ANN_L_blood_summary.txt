For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where the change in feature A is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.269, B: -0.038, C: -0.179, D: 0.130
   - Change in Input: A: 0.336, B: -0.339, C: -0.077, D: -0.026
   - Change in Input: A: 0.233, B: -0.068, C: -0.200, D: 0.150
   - Change in Input: A: 0.177, B: -0.139, C: -0.148, D: 0.279
   - Change in Input: A: 0.289, B: 0.066, C: -0.018, D: 0.199
   - Change in Input: A: 0.175, B: -0.178, C: -0.293, D: 0.130
   - Change in Input: A: 0.309, B: -0.135, C: 0.026, D: 0.113
   
b. Instances where the change in feature A is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.172, B: 0.282, C: 0.053, D: -0.192
   - Change in Input: A: -0.205, B: 0.161, C: 0.257, D: -0.038
   - Change in Input: A: -0.394, B: -0.004, C: 0.108, D: 0.058
   - Change in Input: A: -0.202, B: 0.097, C: 0.171, D: -0.156
   - Change in Input: A: -0.243, B: -0.012, C: 0.162, D: -0.139
   - Change in Input: A: -0.354, B: -0.047, C: 0.069, D: -0.064
   - Change in Input: A: -0.209, B: 0.216, C: 0.030, D: -0.198
   - Change in Input: A: -0.143, B: 0.327, C: 0.156, D: -0.108

From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature A is positive, the change in output is consistently 0. On the other hand, when the change in feature A is negative, the change in output is a mix of 0 and 1. This suggests that positive changes in feature A do not have a significant impact on the output, while negative changes in feature A might have some influence on the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature A in determining the output as 40 out of 100. This rating reflects the fact that positive changes in feature A do not have a strong correlation with the output, but negative changes might have some influence.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where the change in feature B is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.336, B: -0.339, C: -0.077, D: -0.026

From the instances above, we can observe that the change in feature B does not have a consistent correlation with the change in output. Both positive and negative changes in feature B result in a mix of 0 and 1 in the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature B in determining the output as 50 out of 100. This rating reflects the fact that changes in feature B do not have a strong correlation with the output.

3. Feature C:
a. Instances where the change in feature C is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.172, B: 0.282, C: 0.053, D: -0.192

   - Change in Input: A: 0.233, B: -0.068, C: -0.200, D: 0.150
   - Change in Input: A: 0.309, B: -0.135, C: 0.026, D: 0.113
   - Change in Input: A: 0.270, B: -0.076, C: -0.037, D: 0.273

From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature C is positive, the change in output is consistently 1.
