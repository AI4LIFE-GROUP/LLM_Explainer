For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where A has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.301, B: -0.120, C: -0.263, D: 0.058 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.297, B: -0.391, C: -0.056, D: 0.042 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.169, C: -0.127, D: 0.102 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.378, B: -0.144, C: -0.082, D: 0.070 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.328, B: -0.098, C: -0.132, D: 0.073 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.288, B: 0.004, C: -0.269, D: 0.044 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.267, B: -0.020, C: -0.151, D: 0.188 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.340, B: -0.321, C: -0.095, D: 0.174 

b. Instances where A has negative changes:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.148, B: 0.285, C: 0.231, D: -0.148 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.196, B: 0.163, C: 0.166, D: -0.144 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.133, B: 0.218, C: 0.264, D: -0.121 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.255, B: 0.171, C: 0.150, D: -0.138 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.209, B: 0.301, C: 0.108, D: -0.012 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.194, B: 0.136, C: 0.344, D: -0.087

From the above analysis, we can observe that when feature A has positive changes, the corresponding change in output is consistently -1. On the other hand, when feature A has negative changes, the change in output is consistently 0. This indicates a strong negative correlation between feature A and the output. 

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature A in determining the output as 90 out of 100. 

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where B has positive changes:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.301, B: -0.120, C: -0.263, D: 0.058
