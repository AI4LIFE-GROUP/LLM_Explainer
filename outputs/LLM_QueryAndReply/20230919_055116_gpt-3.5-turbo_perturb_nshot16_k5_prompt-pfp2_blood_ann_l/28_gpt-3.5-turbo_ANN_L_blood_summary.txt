For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where A has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.359, B: -0.028, C: -0.047, D: 0.101 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.364, B: -0.269, C: 0.035, D: -0.021 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.313, B: 0.028, C: -0.100, D: 0.146 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.426, B: -0.076, C: -0.018, D: 0.020 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.248, B: -0.072, C: 0.013, D: 0.264 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.259, B: -0.201, C: 0.016, D: 0.162 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.355, B: -0.062, C: -0.167, D: 0.138 

b. Instances where A has negative changes:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.245, B: 0.187, C: 0.089, D: -0.104 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.176, B: 0.310, C: 0.011, D: -0.267 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.270, B: 0.105, C: 0.094, D: -0.028 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.320, B: 0.095, C: 0.066, D: -0.193 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.274, B: 0.062, C: 0.158, D: -0.045 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.236, B: 0.059, C: 0.264, D: 0.035 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.453, B: 0.082, C: 0.117, D: -0.073 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.128, B: 0.166, C: 0.266, D: -0.111 

From the instances analyzed, it appears that when A has positive changes, the output tends to be -1, while when A has negative changes, the output tends to be 0. This suggests a positive correlation between positive changes in A and a negative output, and a negative correlation between negative changes in A and a positive output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature A in determining the output as 70 out of 100. This rating takes into account the equal emphasis on both positive and negative correlations.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where B has positive changes:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.359, B: -0.028, C: -0.047, D: 0.101 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.176, B: 0.310, C: 0.011, D: -0.267 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.270, B: 0.105, C: 0.094, D: -0.028 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.320, B: 0.095, C: 0.066, D: -0.193 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.274, B: 0.062, C: 0.158, D: -0.045 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.236, B: 0.059, C: 0.264, D: 0.035 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.453, B: 0.082, C: 0.117, D: -0.073 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.128, B: 0.166, C: 0.266, D: -0.111 

b. Instances where B has negative changes:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.364, B: -0.269, C: 0.035, D: -0.021 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.313, B: 0.028, C: -0.100, D: 0.146

   - Change in Input: A: 0.248, B: -0.072, C: 0.013, D: 0.264 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.259, B: -0.201, C: 0.016, D: 0.162 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.355, B: -0.062, C: -0.167, D: 0.138 

From the instances analyzed, it seems that when B has positive changes, the output tends to be 0, while when B has negative changes, the output tends to be -1. This suggests a negative correlation between positive changes in B and the output, and a positive correlation between negative changes in B and the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature B in determining the output as 60 out of 100.

   - Change in Input: A: 0.355, B: -0.062, C: -0.167, D: 0.138 

From the instances analyzed, it appears that when C has positive changes, the output tends to be 0, while when C has negative changes, the output tends to be -1. This suggests a negative correlation between positive changes in C and the output, and a positive correlation between negative changes in C and the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature C in determining the output as 60 out of 100.
