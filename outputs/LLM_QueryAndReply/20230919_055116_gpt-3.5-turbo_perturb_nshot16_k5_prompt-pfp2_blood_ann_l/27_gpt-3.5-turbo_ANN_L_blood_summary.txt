For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.370, B: -0.091, C: 0.010, D: 0.063 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.360, B: -0.114, C: -0.039, D: 0.018 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.283, B: -0.031, C: -0.143, D: 0.141 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.252, B: -0.010, C: -0.071, D: 0.231 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.282, B: 0.130, C: -0.063, D: 0.236 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.381, B: 0.014, C: -0.096, D: 0.010 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.276, B: -0.084, C: -0.094, D: 0.220 

b. Instances with negative changes in A: 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.346, B: 0.103, C: 0.078, D: -0.150 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.296, B: 0.202, C: 0.130, D: 0.048 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.214, B: 0.114, C: 0.180, D: -0.153 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.222, B: 0.175, C: 0.216, D: -0.062 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.257, B: 0.126, C: 0.239, D: -0.025 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.278, B: 0.152, C: 0.087, D: -0.083 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.211, B: 0.189, C: 0.209, D: -0.239 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.268, B: 0.074, C: 0.094, D: -0.216 

From the instances analyzed, it seems that when there is a positive change in feature A, the output tends to be -1. On the other hand, when there is a negative change in feature A, the output tends to be 0. This suggests that feature A has a strong correlation with the output.

Rating the importance of feature A on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations, I would assign it a score of 90. This indicates that feature A is highly important in determining the output.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.370, B: -0.091, C: 0.010, D: 0.063 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.346, B: 0.103, C: 0.078, D: -0.150 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.296, B: 0.202, C: 0.130, D: 0.048 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.214, B: 0.114, C: 0.180, D: -0.153

   - Change in Input: A: 0.276, B: -0.084, C: -0.094, D: 0.220 

From the instances analyzed, it appears that both positive and negative changes in feature B are associated with both output values (-1 and 0). This suggests that feature B has a moderate correlation with the output.

Rating the importance of feature B on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations, I would assign it a score of 50. This indicates that feature B is moderately important in determining the output.

Based on the analysis of features A and B, the running rank is AB.

   - Change in Input: A: 0.276, B: -0.084, C: -0.094, D: 0.220 

From the instances analyzed, it seems that positive changes in feature C are associated with both output values (-1 and 0), while negative changes in feature C are mainly associated with output value 0. This suggests that feature C has a weak correlation with the output.

Rating the importance of feature C on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations, I would assign it a score of 30. This indicates that feature C has a relatively low importance in determining the output.
