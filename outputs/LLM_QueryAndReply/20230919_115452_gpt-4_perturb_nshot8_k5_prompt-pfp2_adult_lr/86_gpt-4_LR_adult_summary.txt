For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go. Do not provide the same importance for any two features.


REPLY:
Analyzing the given dataset, it's clear that the change in output is always 0, regardless of the changes in the input features. This suggests that the model is not sensitive to the changes in the input features, or that the changes in the input features are not significant enough to cause a change in the output. 

Given this, it's impossible to determine the correlation between the changes in the input features and the change in output, as there is no change in output to correlate with. Similarly, it's impossible to rate the importance of each feature in determining the output, as none of the features appear to have any effect on the output.

Therefore, it's also impossible to rank the features in terms of their importance in determining the output. All features would have the same rank, as none of them appear to have any effect on the output.

In conclusion, based on the given dataset, all features from 'A' to 'M' have the same importance in determining the output, which is none. The final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' is therefore arbitrary, as none of the features appear to have any effect on the output.
