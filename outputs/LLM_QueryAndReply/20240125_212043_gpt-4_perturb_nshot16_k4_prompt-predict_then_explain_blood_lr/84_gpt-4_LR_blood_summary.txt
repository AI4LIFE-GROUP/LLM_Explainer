The change in output seems to be mostly 0, with only one instance of a change to 1. This makes it difficult to determine the exact impact of each feature on the output. However, we can make some observations. 

The only instance where the output changes to 1, feature 'D' has the highest value among all instances. This could suggest that 'D' has a significant impact on the output. However, in other instances where 'D' is high, the output remains 0. This could mean that 'D' needs to be high along with certain conditions in other features for the output to change.

Features 'A', 'B', and 'C' also show some variability, but it's hard to draw a clear relationship with the output. 'A' tends to be high when the output is 0, but it's not always the case. 'B' and 'C' don't show a clear pattern either.

Given these observations, it's difficult to definitively rank the features in terms of importance. However, based on the available data, a possible ranking could be:

D, A, B, C
