Question: "Based on the above set, estimate the change in output for the final change in input. What are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Provide the estimated change in output immediately as a single integer on the first line of your response. Do not provide any further details on the first line. Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas.

The change in output seems to be primarily driven by the values of the features. When the values of 'A' are high (around 0.6 or above) and 'C' is low (around 0.1 or below), the change in output tends to be 0. Conversely, when 'A' is low (around 0.2 or below) and 'C' is high (around 0.2 or above), the change in output tends to be 1. The values of 'B' and 'D' also seem to have some influence, but not as much as 'A' and 'C'. 

A, C, B, D
