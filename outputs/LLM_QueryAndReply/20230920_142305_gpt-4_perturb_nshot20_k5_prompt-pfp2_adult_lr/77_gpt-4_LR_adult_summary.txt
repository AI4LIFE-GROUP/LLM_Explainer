For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'A'. There doesn't seem to be a clear correlation between changes in 'A' and changes in output.
b. Importance: 30. 'A' doesn't seem to have a strong influence on the output, but it does have some effect.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' are mostly associated with negative changes in output, while negative changes in 'B' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output. This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and output.
b. Importance: 50. 'B' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A', particularly when 'B' increases.

Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. Changes in 'C' don't seem to have a clear correlation with changes in output. Both positive and negative changes in 'C' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output.
b. Importance: 20. 'C' seems to have less influence on the output than both 'A' and 'B'.

Rank: BAC

4. Feature 'D':
a. Positive changes in 'D' are mostly associated with positive changes in output, while negative changes in 'D' are mostly associated with negative changes in output. This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'D' and output.

Rank: DBAC

5. Feature 'E':
a. Changes in 'E' don't seem to have a clear correlation with changes in output. Both positive and negative changes in 'E' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output.
