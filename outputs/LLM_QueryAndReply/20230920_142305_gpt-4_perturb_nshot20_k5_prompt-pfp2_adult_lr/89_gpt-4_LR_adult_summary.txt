For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we can make the following observations:

1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' seem to have no clear correlation with the output, as both positive and negative changes in 'A' result in both 0 and -1 changes in output. 
b. Given the lack of clear correlation, the importance of 'A' in determining the output is rated as 50/100.
Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' mostly result in -1 changes in output, while negative changes in 'B' mostly result in 0 changes in output. This suggests a negative correlation.
b. The importance of 'B' in determining the output is rated as 60/100, as it seems to have a stronger correlation with the output than 'A'.
Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. Both positive and negative changes in 'C' result in both 0 and -1 changes in output, suggesting no clear correlation.
b. The importance of 'C' in determining the output is rated as 50/100, similar to 'A'.
