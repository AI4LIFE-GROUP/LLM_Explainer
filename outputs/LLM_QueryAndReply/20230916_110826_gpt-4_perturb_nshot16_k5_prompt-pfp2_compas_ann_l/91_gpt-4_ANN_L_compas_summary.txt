For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'F':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'F' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'F' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0). When 'A' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance of 'A': 80. It seems to have a strong influence on the output, especially when it decreases.

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output tends to decrease (-1). When 'B' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance of 'B': 70. It seems to have a strong influence on the output, but not as strong as 'A'.
Rank so far: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to decrease (-1). When 'C' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests a negative correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance of 'C': 75. It seems to have a strong influence on the output, slightly stronger than 'B' but not as strong as 'A'.
Rank so far: ACB

4. Feature 'D':
a. 'D' seems to have little correlation with the output. Both when 'D' increases and decreases, the output can either stay the same or decrease.
b. Importance of 'D': 40. It seems to have a weaker influence on the output compared to 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
Rank so far: ACBD

5. Feature 'E':
a. 'E' seems to have little correlation with the output. Both when 'E' increases and decreases, the output can either stay the same or decrease.
b. Importance of 'E': 35. It seems to have a weaker influence on the output compared to 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'.
Rank so far: ACBDE

6. Feature 'F':
a. 'F' seems to have little correlation with the output. Both when 'F' increases and decreases, the output can either stay the same or decrease.
b. Importance of 'F': 30. It seems to have the weakest influence on the output compared to all other features.
Final rank: ACBDEF
