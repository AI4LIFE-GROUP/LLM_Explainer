For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'F':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'F' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'F' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to increase (7 out of 8 times). When 'A' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (6 out of 8 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance of 'A': 85/100. 'A' seems to have a strong influence on the output.

Rank so far: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output tends to stay the same (7 out of 7 times). When 'B' decreases, the output tends to increase (8 out of 9 times). This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance of 'B': 90/100. 'B' seems to have a very strong influence on the output, even stronger than 'A'.

Rank so far: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to stay the same (7 out of 7 times). When 'C' decreases, the output tends to increase (8 out of 9 times). This suggests a negative correlation between 'C' and the output, similar to 'B'.
b. Importance of 'C': 90/100. 'C' seems to have a very strong influence on the output, similar to 'B'.

Rank so far: BCA

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output tends to increase (6 out of 8 times). When 'D' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (5 out of 8 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'D' and the output, but not as strong as 'A'.
b. Importance of 'D': 70/100. 'D' seems to have a moderate influence on the output.

Rank so far: BCAD

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output tends to increase (3 out of 3 times). When 'E' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (8 out of 13 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'E' and the output, but the number of instances is too small to draw a strong conclusion.
b. Importance of 'E': 60/100. 'E' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but less than 'D'.

Rank so far: BCDAE

6. Feature 'F':
a. When 'F' increases, the output tends to stay the same (5 out of 5 times). When 'F' decreases, the output tends to increase (6 out of 11 times). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'F' and the output.
b. Importance of 'F': 50/100. 'F' seems to have a weak influence on the output, less than 'E'.

Final Rank: BCDAEF
