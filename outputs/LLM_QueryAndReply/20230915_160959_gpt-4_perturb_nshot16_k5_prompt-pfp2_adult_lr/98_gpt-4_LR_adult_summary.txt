For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output is more likely to be 1 (3 out of 5 instances). When 'A' decreases, the output is more likely to be 0 (6 out of 11 instances). This suggests a positive correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'A' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but it's not consistent.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output is equally likely to be 0 or 1 (4 instances each). When 'B' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (5 out of 8 instances). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'B' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A'.

Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output is more likely to be 1 (6 out of 7 instances). When 'C' decreases, the output is more likely to be 0 (6 out of 9 instances). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance: 80. 'C' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than both 'A' and 'B'.

Rank: CAB

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output is more likely to be 1 (7 out of 8 instances). When 'D' decreases, the output is more likely to be 0 (7 out of 8 instances). This suggests a very strong positive correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance: 90. 'D' seems to have a very strong influence on the output, stronger than 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

Rank: DCAB

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output is equally likely to be 0 or 1 (3 instances each). When 'E' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (7 out of 10 instances). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'E' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'E' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'.

Rank: DCABE

6. Feature 'F':
a. When 'F' increases, the output is more likely to be 1 (5 out of 6 instances). When 'F' decreases, the output is more likely to be 0 (7 out of 10 instances). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'F' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'F' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A', 'B', and 'E', but weaker than 'C' and 'D'.

Rank: DCFABE

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output is more likely to be 0 (5 out of 8 instances). When 'G' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (4 out of 6 instances). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'G' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F'.

Rank: DCFABEG

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output is more likely to be 0 (5 out of 8 instances). When 'H' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (5 out of 8 instances). This suggests a weak correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'H' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F'.

Rank: DCFABEGH

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output is more likely to be 0 (6 out of 9 instances). When 'I' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance: 50. 'I' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, stronger than 'B', 'E', 'G', and 'H', but weaker than 'A', 'C', 'D', and 'F'.

Rank: DCFABIJEGH

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output is more likely to be 0 (6 out of 10 instances). When 'J' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (3 out of 4 instances). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'J' and the output.
b. Importance: 50. 'J' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'I'.

Rank: DCFABIJJEGH

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output is more likely to be 0 (5 out of 8 instances). When 'K' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (5 out of 8 instances). This suggests a weak correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'K' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'I', and 'J'.

Rank: DCFABIJJEGHK

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output is more likely to be 0 (5 out of 8 instances). When 'L' decreases, the output is more likely to be 1 (5 out of 8 instances). This suggests a weak correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'L' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'I', and 'J'.

Rank: DCFABIJJEGHKL

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output is more likely to be 1 (5 out of 7 instances). When 'M' decreases, the output is more likely to be 0 (6 out of 9 instances). This suggests a moderate positive correlation between 'M' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'M' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'A'.

Final Rank: DCFABIMIJJEGHKL
