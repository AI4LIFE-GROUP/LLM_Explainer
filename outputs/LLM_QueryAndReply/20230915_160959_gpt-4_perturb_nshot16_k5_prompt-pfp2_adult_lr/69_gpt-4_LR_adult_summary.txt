For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'A'. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'A' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'A': 30/100. The influence of 'A' on the output is not very clear, hence the low score.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'B' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'B' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'B': 40/100. 'B' seems to have a slightly higher influence on the output than 'A', but it's still not very clear.

Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. Positive changes in 'C' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'C' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'C' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'C': 60/100. 'C' seems to have a more clear influence on the output than 'A' and 'B'.

Rank: CBA

4. Feature 'D':
a. Positive changes in 'D' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'D' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'D' and the change in output.

Rank: DCBA

5. Feature 'E':
a. Positive changes in 'E' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'E' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'E' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'E': 50/100. 'E' seems to have a moderate influence on the output.

Rank: DCBEA

6. Feature 'F':
a. Positive changes in 'F' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'F'. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'F' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'F': 40/100. The influence of 'F' on the output is not very clear, hence the low score.

Rank: DCBEFA

7. Feature 'G':
a. Positive changes in 'G' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'G' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'G' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'G': 60/100. 'G' seems to have a more clear influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'F', and 'E', but less than 'C' and 'D'.

Rank: DCGBEFA

8. Feature 'H':
a. Positive changes in 'H' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'H' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'H' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'H': 70/100. 'H' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'F', 'E', and 'G', but equal to 'D'.

Rank: HDGCBFEA

9. Feature 'I':
a. Positive changes in 'I' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'I'. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'I' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'I': 40/100. The influence of 'I' on the output is not very clear, hence the low score.

Rank: HDGCBFEIA

10. Feature 'J':
a. Positive changes in 'J' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'J' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'J' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'J': 60/100. 'J' seems to have a more clear influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'F', 'E', and 'I', but less than 'C', 'D', 'G', and 'H'.

Rank: HDGCBJFEIA

11. Feature 'K':
a. Positive changes in 'K' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'K'. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'K' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'K': 40/100. The influence of 'K' on the output is not very clear, hence the low score.

Rank: HDGCBJFEKIA

12. Feature 'L':
a. Positive changes in 'L' mostly correlate with no change in output, while negative changes in 'L' mostly correlate with a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation between the change in 'L' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'L': 60/100. 'L' seems to have a more clear influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'F', 'E', 'I', and 'K', but less than 'C', 'D', 'G', 'H', and 'J'.

Rank: HDGCBJLFEKIA

13. Feature 'M':
a. Positive changes in 'M' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'M'. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'M' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'M': 40/100. The influence of 'M' on the output is not very clear, hence the low score.
