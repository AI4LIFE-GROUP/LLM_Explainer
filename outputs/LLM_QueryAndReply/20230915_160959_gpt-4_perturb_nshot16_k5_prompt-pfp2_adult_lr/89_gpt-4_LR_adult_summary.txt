For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output, and the same is true for negative changes in 'A'. There is no clear correlation between the change in 'A' and the change in output.
b. Importance of 'A': 20/100. The lack of a clear correlation reduces the importance of 'A' in determining the output.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' mostly correlate with positive changes in output, while negative changes in 'B' mostly correlate with negative changes in output. This suggests a positive correlation between 'B' and the output.

Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. Changes in 'C' do not show a clear correlation with changes in output. Both positive and negative changes in 'C' correlate with both positive and negative changes in output.
