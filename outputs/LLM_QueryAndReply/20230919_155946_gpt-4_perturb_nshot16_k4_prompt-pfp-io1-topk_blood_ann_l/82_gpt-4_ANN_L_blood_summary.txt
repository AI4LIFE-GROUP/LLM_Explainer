Question: "Based on the model's predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top four most important features in determining the model's prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top four most important features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
Reasoning: The dataset shows that when the value of feature 'A' increases, the output decreases and vice versa. The same trend is seen with feature 'B' but in the opposite direction - when 'B' increases, the output increases and vice versa. However, the relationship for feature 'C' and 'D' is not as clear. They both show changes in the same direction as the output, but not as consistently as 'A' and 'B'. Hence, we could infer that 'A' and 'B' have a higher importance in determining the output. Among 'C' and 'D', 'C' shows a bit more consistency than 'D' and hence might be ranked higher. 

Answer: 
A, B, C, D
