For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go. Do not provide the same importance for any two features.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' mostly correspond to no change in output, while negative changes in 'A' mostly correspond to a decrease in output. This suggests that increases in 'A' may stabilize the output, while decreases in 'A' may destabilize it.
b. Importance: 70. 'A' seems to have a significant influence on the output, especially when it decreases.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' correspond to both no change and decrease in output, while negative changes in 'B' mostly correspond to no change in output. This suggests that 'B' has a less clear influence on the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'B' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output than 'A'.

Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. Positive changes in 'C' mostly correspond to no change in output, while negative changes in 'C' mostly correspond to a decrease in output. This suggests that 'C' has a similar influence on the output as 'A'.
b. Importance: 65. 'C' seems to have a significant but slightly less consistent influence on the output than 'A'.

Rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D':
a. Positive changes in 'D' mostly correspond to no change in output, while negative changes in 'D' always correspond to a decrease in output. This suggests that 'D' has a strong influence on the output, especially when it decreases.
b. Importance: 80. 'D' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A' and 'C'.

Rank: DACB

5. Feature 'E':
a. Changes in 'E' do not show a clear correlation with changes in output. This suggests that 'E' has a less clear influence on the output.

Rank: DACBHFG

9. Feature 'I':
a. Changes in 'I' do not show a clear correlation with changes in output. This suggests that 'I' has a less clear influence on the output.
