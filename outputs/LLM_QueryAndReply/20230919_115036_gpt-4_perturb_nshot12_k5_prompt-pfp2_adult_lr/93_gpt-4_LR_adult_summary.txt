For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go. Do not provide the same importance for any two features.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output. However, negative changes in 'A' are only associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that a decrease in 'A' is likely to result in a decrease in output, but an increase in 'A' does not guarantee an increase in output.
b. Importance: 60. 'A' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, especially when it decreases.

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output. Negative changes in 'B' are also associated with both positive and negative changes in output. This suggests that changes in 'B' do not have a clear correlation with changes in output.
b. Importance: 30. 'B' seems to have a lower influence on the output compared to 'A'.

Rank so far: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. Positive changes in 'C' are mostly associated with positive changes in output, while negative changes in 'C' are mostly associated with negative changes in output. This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance: 80. 'C' seems to have a strong influence on the output.

Rank so far: CAB

4. Feature 'D':
a. Positive changes in 'D' are mostly associated with positive changes in output, while negative changes in 'D' are mostly associated with negative changes in output. This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance: 90. 'D' seems to have a very strong influence on the output.

Rank so far: DCAB

5. Feature 'E':
a. Changes in 'E' do not show a clear correlation with changes in output. Both positive and negative changes in 'E' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output.
b. Importance: 40. 'E' seems to have a lower influence on the output compared to 'A', 'C', and 'D'.

Rank so far: DCABE

6. Feature 'F':
a. Positive changes in 'F' are mostly associated with positive changes in output, while negative changes in 'F' are mostly associated with negative changes in output. This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'F' and the output.

Rank so far: DCFAEBG

8. Feature 'H':
a. Negative changes in 'H' are mostly associated with positive changes in output, while positive changes in 'H' are mostly associated with negative changes in output. This suggests a strong negative correlation between 'H' and the output.

Rank so far: DCHFAEBG

9. Feature 'I':
a. Changes in 'I' do not show a clear correlation with changes in output. Both positive and negative changes in 'I' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output.
