For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go. Do not provide the same importance for any two features.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output, but negative changes in 'A' are only associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that a decrease in 'A' might be a strong indicator of a decrease in output.
b. Importance: 70. The feature 'A' seems to have a significant impact on the output, especially when it decreases.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output, but negative changes in 'B' are only associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that a decrease in 'B' might be a strong indicator of a decrease in output.
b. Importance: 75. The feature 'B' seems to have a slightly stronger impact on the output than 'A', especially when it decreases.

Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. Positive changes in 'C' are associated with positive changes in output, but negative changes in 'C' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output. This suggests that an increase in 'C' might be a strong indicator of an increase in output.
b. Importance: 60. The feature 'C' seems to have a significant but slightly less impact on the output than 'A' and 'B'.

Rank: BAC

4. Feature 'D':
a. Positive changes in 'D' are associated with positive changes in output, but negative changes in 'D' are only associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that 'D' has a strong correlation with the output.
