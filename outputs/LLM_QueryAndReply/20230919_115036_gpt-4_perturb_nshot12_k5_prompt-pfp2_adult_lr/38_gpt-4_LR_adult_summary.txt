For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go. Do not provide the same importance for any two features.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output, while negative changes in 'A' are only associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that increases in 'A' may have a mixed effect on output, while decreases in 'A' may lead to a decrease in output.
b. Importance: 60. 'A' seems to have a significant influence on the output, but the relationship is not entirely clear due to the mixed effects of positive changes.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' are associated with no change in output, while negative changes in 'B' are associated with both positive and negative changes in output. This suggests that 'B' may have a less clear influence on the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'B' seems to have less influence on the output than 'A', as its changes are less clearly associated with changes in output.

Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. Positive changes in 'C' are associated with no change in output, while negative changes in 'C' are associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that decreases in 'C' may lead to a decrease in output.
b. Importance: 50. 'C' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, with decreases in 'C' potentially leading to decreases in output.

Rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D':
a. Positive changes in 'D' are associated with no change in output, while negative changes in 'D' are associated with negative changes in output. This suggests that decreases in 'D' may lead to a decrease in output.
