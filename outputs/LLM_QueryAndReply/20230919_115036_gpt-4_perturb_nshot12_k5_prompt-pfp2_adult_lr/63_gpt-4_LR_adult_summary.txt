For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go. Do not provide the same importance for any two features.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. Positive changes in 'A' do not seem to have a consistent correlation with the output, as the output remains 0 in two instances and decreases in one. Negative changes in 'A' also do not show a consistent correlation, as the output remains 0 in two instances and decreases in three. 
b. Given the lack of consistent correlation, the importance of 'A' in determining the output is rated as 30.

2. Feature 'B':
a. Positive changes in 'B' result in the output remaining 0 in five instances and decreasing in two. Negative changes in 'B' result in the output remaining 0 in one instance and decreasing in two. This suggests a slightly stronger correlation with the output than 'A'.
b. The importance of 'B' in determining the output is rated as 40.

Rank after 'B': BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. Positive changes in 'C' result in the output remaining 0 in four instances. Negative changes in 'C' result in the output decreasing in four instances. This suggests a stronger correlation with the output than 'A' and 'B'.
