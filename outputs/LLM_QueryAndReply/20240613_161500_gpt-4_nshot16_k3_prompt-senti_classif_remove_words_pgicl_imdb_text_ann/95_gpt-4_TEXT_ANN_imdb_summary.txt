Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows the change in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output of -1 indicates that the removal of the word(s) had a significant impact on the model's output, while a change of 0 indicates that the removal of the word(s) had no impact. 

1. "This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it." - The removal of the entire sentence results in a change of 0, indicating that none of the words in the sentence are individually crucial to the output.

2. "This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute." - The removal of "it" results in a change of -1, indicating that "it" is important to the output.

3. "Movie was of long in length, but I every minute of it." - The removal of "this", "kind", "enjoyed" results in a change of 0, indicating that these words are not crucial to the output.

4. "This movie was kind of long length, but I enjoyed every minute of it." - The removal of "in" results in a change of -1, indicating that "in" is important to the output.

5. "This was of in length enjoyed." - The removal of "movie", "kind", "long", "but", "I", "every", "minute", "of", "it" results in a change of 0, indicating that these words are not crucial to the output.

6. "Long in length, but I enjoyed" - The removal of "this", "movie", "was", "kind", "of", "every", "minute", "of", "it" results in a change of -1, indicating that these words are important to the output.

From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the words "it", "in", and "this", "movie", "was", "kind", "of", "every", "minute", "of", "it" are the most important in driving the output. 

Final ranking: "it", "in", "this", "movie", "was", "kind", "of", "every", "minute", "of", "it".
