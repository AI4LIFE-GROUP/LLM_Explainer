Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence changes the model's output. The change in output is either 0 or 1, with 1 indicating a significant change and 0 indicating no change. 

1. "There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done." - This is the original sentence. The removal of any part of this sentence results in a change in output, indicating that all words in this sentence are important to some degree.

2. "There is simply no for something this poorly done." - The removal of "excuse" results in a change in output, indicating that "excuse" is a significant word.

3. "There is simply no" - The removal of "excuse for something this poorly done" results in no change in output, indicating that these words are not as significant.

4. "Is simply no excuse for something this done." - The removal of "poorly" results in a change in output, indicating that "poorly" is a significant word.

5. "Is simply" - The removal of "no excuse for something this poorly done" results in no change in output, indicating that these words are not as significant.

6. "Simply no for something poorly done." - The removal of "there is" and "this" results in a change in output, indicating that "there is" and "this" are significant words.

7. "This done" - The removal of "there is simply no excuse for something this poorly" results in no change in output, indicating that these words are not as significant.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "excuse", "poorly", and "there is". These words consistently result in a change in output when removed, indicating their importance in determining the model's output.

Final Answer: Excuse, Poorly, There is
