Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are those that, when removed, cause a change in output. In this case, the words that cause a change in output when removed are 'keep', 'going', and 'first'. 

1. 'Keep': This word appears in all the sentences where the output changes. When it is removed, the output decreases by 1. This suggests that 'keep' has a strong positive correlation with the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

2. 'Going': Like 'keep', 'going' also appears in all the sentences where the output changes. Its removal also results in a decrease in output by 1, indicating a strong positive correlation. I would rate its importance as 100.

3. 'First': This word appears in most of the sentences where the output changes. When it is removed, the output decreases by 1. This suggests that 'first' has a positive correlation with the output, but perhaps not as strong as 'keep' and 'going'. I would rate its importance as 90.

Comparing these three words, 'keep' and 'going' seem to be equally important, with 'first' slightly less so. Therefore, the final ranking would be 'keep', 'going', 'first'.

Keep, Going, First
