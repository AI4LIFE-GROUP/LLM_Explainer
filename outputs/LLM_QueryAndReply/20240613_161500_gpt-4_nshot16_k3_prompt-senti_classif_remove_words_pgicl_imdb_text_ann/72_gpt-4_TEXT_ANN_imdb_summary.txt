Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'saw', 'just', and 'film'. 

1. 'Saw': This word appears in 6 instances where the output changes to 1 when removed, and does not appear in any instance where the output changes to 0 when removed. This suggests a strong positive correlation between the presence of 'saw' and the output being 1. Importance: 90

2. 'Just': This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes to 1 when removed, and in 2 instances where the output changes to 0 when removed. This suggests a positive correlation between the presence of 'just' and the output being 1, but not as strong as 'saw'. Importance: 70

3. 'Film': This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes to 1 when removed, and in 1 instance where the output changes to 0 when removed. This suggests a positive correlation between the presence of 'film' and the output being 1, but not as strong as 'saw' or 'just'. Importance: 60

The other words ('this', 'and', 'i', 'recommend', 'it', '.') appear in a roughly equal number of instances where the output changes to 1 or 0 when removed, suggesting they have less influence on the output.

Final rank: saw, just, film
