Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'so', 'is', and 'this movie'. 

The word 'so' appears to have the most significant impact. Every time it is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that 'so' has a strong positive correlation with the output. Therefore, I would rate 'so' as 100 in terms of importance.

The word 'is' also has a significant impact. Every time it is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that 'is' has a strong positive correlation with the output. Therefore, I would rate 'is' as 90 in terms of importance, slightly less than 'so' because it appears less frequently in the dataset.

The phrase 'this movie' also seems to have an impact. When it is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that 'this movie' has a positive correlation with the output. However, it only appears once in the dataset, so it's hard to determine its overall importance. I would rate 'this movie' as 80 in terms of importance.

The words 'awesome' and '!', on the other hand, do not seem to have any impact on the output. Every time they are removed, the output remains the same. Therefore, I would rate 'awesome' and '!' as 0 in terms of importance.

Final rank: so, is, this movie, awesome, !
