Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence results in a change in output, while the removal of other words does not. This suggests that the words whose removal causes a change in output are more important in driving the output. 

1. "The show" - This phrase appears in 8 instances of word removals, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "the show" is quite important in determining the output. Importance: 70

2. "Would" - This word appears in 7 instances of word removals, and in 3 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "would" is somewhat important in determining the output. Importance: 60

3. "Smart ass" - This phrase appears in 6 instances of word removals, and in 3 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "smart ass" is somewhat important in determining the output. Importance: 60

4. "Totally" - This word appears in 6 instances of word removals, and in 3 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "totally" is somewhat important in determining the output. Importance: 60

5. "Uncalled for" - This phrase appears in 5 instances of word removals, and in 2 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "uncalled for" is somewhat important in determining the output. Importance: 50

6. "Off the wall" - This phrase appears in 5 instances of word removals, and in 2 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "off the wall" is somewhat important in determining the output. Importance: 50

7. "Begin" - This word appears in 4 instances of word removals, and in 2 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "begin" is somewhat important in determining the output. Importance: 50

8. "Comments" - This word appears in 4 instances of word removals, and in 1 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "comments" is less important in determining the output. Importance: 40

9. "Ed" - This word appears in 3 instances of word removals, and in 1 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "ed" is less important in determining the output. Importance: 40

10. "With" - This word appears in 3 instances of word removals, and in 1 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that "with" is less important in determining the output. Importance: 40

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words or phrases driving the output are "the show", "would", and "smart ass".

The show, would, smart ass
