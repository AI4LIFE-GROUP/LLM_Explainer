Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "young", "being", and "so". 

"Young" appears to be the most important word. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that the model is sensitive to the age of the actor, which is a key factor in the sentence. 

"Being" is the second most important word. It is also consistently associated with a change in output when removed. This suggests that the model is sensitive to the state or condition of the actor, which is expressed by the word "being".

"So" is the third most important word. It is associated with a change in output in most cases when removed. This suggests that the model is sensitive to the degree or extent of something, which is expressed by the word "so".

The other words in the sentence do not seem to have as much impact on the output. They are either not associated with a change in output when removed or are associated with a change in output less consistently.

Final ranking: young, being, so.
