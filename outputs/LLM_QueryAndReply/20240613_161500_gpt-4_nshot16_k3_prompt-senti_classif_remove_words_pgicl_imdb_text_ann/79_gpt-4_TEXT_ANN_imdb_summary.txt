Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence does not change the output (Change in output: 0), while the removal of other words decreases the output by 1 (Change in output: -1). This suggests that the words whose removal decreases the output are more important in driving the output.

1. 'Still': The removal of 'still' does not change the output. This suggests that 'still' has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

2. 'There', 'are', 'around': The removal of these words decreases the output. This suggests that these words are important in driving the output. Importance: 100

3. 'Are': The removal of 'are' does not change the output. This suggests that 'are' has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

4. 'Good': The removal of 'good' does not change the output. This suggests that 'good' has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

5. 'Actors': The removal of 'actors' is not explicitly mentioned in the dataset. However, considering that the removal of 'there', 'are', 'around' decreases the output and the removal of 'still', 'are', 'good' does not change the output, it can be inferred that 'actors' is likely to be important in driving the output. Importance: 100

Ranking the words based on their importance, we get: 'There', 'are', 'around', 'actors' > 'still', 'good', 'are'

Answer: there, are, around, actors, still, good, are
