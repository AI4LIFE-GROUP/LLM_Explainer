Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'yet', 'i', 'enjoy', 'watching', and 'it' are removed. However, the output does not change when the words 'yet', 'i', 'watching', 'it', and 'enjoy' are removed individually. This suggests that the words 'yet', 'i', 'enjoy', 'watching', and 'it' are important in driving the output. 

1. 'Yet': The output changes when 'yet' is removed, suggesting it has a significant influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

2. 'I': The output changes when 'i' is removed, suggesting it also has a significant influence on the output. However, it seems to be less influential than 'yet', so I would rate its importance as 80.

3. 'Enjoy': The output changes when 'enjoy' is removed, suggesting it has a significant influence on the output. However, it seems to be less influential than 'yet' and 'i', so I would rate its importance as 60.

4. 'Watching': The output changes when 'watching' is removed, suggesting it has a significant influence on the output. However, it seems to be less influential than 'yet', 'i', and 'enjoy', so I would rate its importance as 40.

5. 'It': The output changes when 'it' is removed, suggesting it has a significant influence on the output. However, it seems to be less influential than 'yet', 'i', 'enjoy', and 'watching', so I would rate its importance as 20.

Final rank: yet, i, enjoy, watching, it.
