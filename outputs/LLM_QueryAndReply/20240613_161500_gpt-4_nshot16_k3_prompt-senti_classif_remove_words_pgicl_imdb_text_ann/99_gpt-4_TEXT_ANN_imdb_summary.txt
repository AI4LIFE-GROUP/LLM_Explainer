Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 or -1, indicating that the removal of some words has no effect on the output, while the removal of others decreases the output by 1.

1. "Delight": The removal of the word "delight" consistently results in a change in output of -1, regardless of whether it is removed alone or in combination with other words. This suggests that "delight" is a key word driving the output. Importance: 100

2. "A": The removal of the word "a" also results in a change in output of -1, but only when it is removed in combination with "delight". When removed in combination with other words, the change in output is 0. This suggests that "a" is less important than "delight", but still has some influence on the output. Importance: 50

3. "Overall": The removal of the word "overall" never results in a change in output, regardless of whether it is removed alone or in combination with other words. This suggests that "overall" has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

4. ",": The removal of the comma never results in a change in output, regardless of whether it is removed alone or in combination with other words. This suggests that the comma has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

5. "!": The removal of the exclamation mark never results in a change in output, regardless of whether it is removed alone or in combination with other words. This suggests that the exclamation mark has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

Final rank: Delight, A, Overall, ",", "!"
