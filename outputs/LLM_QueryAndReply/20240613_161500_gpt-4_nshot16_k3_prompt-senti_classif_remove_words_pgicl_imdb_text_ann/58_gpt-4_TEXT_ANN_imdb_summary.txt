Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is binary, either 0 or 1, indicating that the removal of these words either has no effect or a significant effect on the output. 

1. "well-balanced": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that "well-balanced" has a high importance in determining the output. Importance score: 100.

2. "this movie": This phrase appears in 7 out of 16 removals. In 4 out of these 7 instances, the output changes when the phrase is removed. This suggests that "this movie" has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance score: 57.

3. "comedy": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals. In 4 out of these 8 instances, the output changes when the word is removed. This suggests that "comedy" has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance score: 50.

4. "drama": This word appears in 7 out of 16 removals. In 3 out of these 7 instances, the output changes when the word is removed. This suggests that "drama" has a lower importance in determining the output. Importance score: 43.
