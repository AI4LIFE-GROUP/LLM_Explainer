Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the model's output changes every time a word is removed from the original sentence. This suggests that all words in the sentence have some influence on the model's output. However, some words appear more frequently in the removed words list, indicating that they might have a higher impact on the model's output.

1. 'Number': This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'number' has a significant influence on the model's output. Importance: 90

2. 'Best': This word appears in 7 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'best' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'number'. Importance: 85

3. 'Game': This word appears in 7 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'game' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'number' and 'best'. Importance: 80

4. 'One': This word appears in 6 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'one' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but less than 'number', 'best', and 'game'. Importance: 75

5. 'Th': This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. However, it is often removed in conjunction with other words, making it difficult to determine its individual influence on the model's output. Importance: 70

6. 'Series': This word appears in 6 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. However, it is often removed in conjunction with other words, making it difficult to determine its individual influence on the model's output. Importance: 65

7. 'Is': This word appears in 6 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. However, it is often removed in conjunction with other words, making it difficult to determine its individual influence on the model's output. Importance: 60

8. 'The': This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. However, it is often removed in conjunction with other words, making it difficult to determine its individual influence on the model's output. Importance: 55

9. 'This': This word appears in 6 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. However, it is often removed in conjunction with other words, making it difficult to determine its individual influence on the model's output. Importance: 50

10. 'In': This word appears in 5 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. However, it is often removed in conjunction with other words, making it difficult to determine its individual influence on the model's output. Importance: 45

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'number', 'best', and 'game'.

Final Rank: Number, Best, Game
