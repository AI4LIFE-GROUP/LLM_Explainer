Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 or 1, with 1 indicating a significant change and 0 indicating no change. 

1. 'Great': Every time the word 'great' is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'great' has a high importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

2. 'The': The removal of 'the' does not cause any change in the output. This suggests that 'the' has a low importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 0.

3. 'Was': The removal of 'was' does not cause any change in the output. This suggests that 'was' has a low importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 0.

4. 'Cast': The removal of 'cast' in combination with other words causes a change in the output. However, 'cast' alone is not removed in the dataset, so it's difficult to determine its individual importance. Given the available data, I would rate its importance as 50.

Based on the above analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is: 'great', 'cast', 'the', 'was'.

Great, Cast, The, Was
