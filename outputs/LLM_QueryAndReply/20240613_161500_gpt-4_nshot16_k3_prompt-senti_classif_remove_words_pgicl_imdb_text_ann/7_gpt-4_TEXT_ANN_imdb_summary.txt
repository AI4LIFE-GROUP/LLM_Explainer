Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task is to identify the top three most important words driving the output. To do this, we need to look at the words that, when removed, cause a change in the output. 

1. "would" - This word appears in 8 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 4 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "would" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 80

2. "have" - This word appears in 8 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 4 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "have" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 80

3. "never" - This word appears in 8 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 4 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "never" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 80

4. "realistic" - This word appears in 4 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 2 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "realistic" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 50

5. "mean" - This word appears in 4 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 2 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "mean" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 50

6. "world" - This word appears in 8 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 1 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "world" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 30

7. "pathetic" - This word appears in 8 of the 16 sentences where words were removed. In 1 of these cases, its removal led to a change in output. This suggests that "pathetic" is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 30

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "would", "have", and "never".

would, have, never
