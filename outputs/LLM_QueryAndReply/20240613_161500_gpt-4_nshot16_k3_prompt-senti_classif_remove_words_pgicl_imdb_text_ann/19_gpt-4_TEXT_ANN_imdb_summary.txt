Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the importance of words in a sentence based on their removal and the corresponding change in output. The output changes between 1 and 0, which could represent a binary classification task. 

1. 'If': This word is removed in 9 instances. In 5 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'if' has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

2. 'Want': This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'want' has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

3. 'Movie': This word is removed in 8 instances. In 5 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 3 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'movie' has a slightly higher influence on the output than 'if' and 'want'. Importance: 60

4. 'That': This word is removed in 9 instances. In 5 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'that' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'if'. Importance: 50

5. 'S': This word is removed in 11 instances. In 6 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 5 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 's' has a slightly higher influence on the output than 'if', 'want', and 'that'. Importance: 55

6. 'Gross': This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'gross' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'want'. Importance: 50

7. 'But': This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'but' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'want' and 'gross'. Importance: 50

8. 'Gives': This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'gives' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'want', 'gross', and 'but'. Importance: 50

9. 'Chills': This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'chills' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'want', 'gross', 'but', and 'gives'. Importance: 50

10. 'Is': This word is removed in 9 instances. In 5 of these instances, the output changes to 1, and in 4 instances, it changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'is' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'if' and 'that'. Importance: 50

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'movie', 's', and 'if'.

Final Rank: Movie, S, If
