Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves identifying the words that have the most influence on the model's output. This is done by observing the change in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output indicates that the removed words have some level of influence on the model's output.

1. The word 'okay' appears in 9 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output, suggesting it has a high level of influence. I would rate its importance as 90.

2. The word 'like' appears in 6 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 70.

3. The word 'critic' appears in 7 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 75.

4. The word 'fair' appears in 6 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 70.

5. The word 'give' appears in 7 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 75.

6. The word 'credit' appears in 8 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a high level of influence. I would rate its importance as 80.

7. The word 'creature' appears in 5 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 65.

8. The word 'effects' appears in 4 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 60.

9. The word 'cool' appears in 5 out of 15 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests it has a moderate level of influence. I would rate its importance as 65.

Based on the above analysis, the running rank of the words from most important to least important is: okay, credit, critic, give, like, fair, creature, cool, effects.

okay, credit, critic
