Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
Based on the dataset, it appears that the removal of any word or combination of words from the original sentence does not affect the model's output, as the change in output is consistently 0. This suggests that none of the words in the sentence have a significant influence on the model's output.

However, if we were to rank the words based on their frequency of appearance in the 'Removed words' column, we could infer a relative importance. The word 'filmiing' appears most frequently, followed by 'was', 'expansive', 'less', and finally '.'. This could suggest that 'filmiing' is the most important word, followed by 'was', 'expansive', 'less', and '.'. 

However, it's important to note that this ranking is purely speculative and not based on any actual influence on the model's output, as per the provided dataset.

Filmiing, was, expansive, less, .
