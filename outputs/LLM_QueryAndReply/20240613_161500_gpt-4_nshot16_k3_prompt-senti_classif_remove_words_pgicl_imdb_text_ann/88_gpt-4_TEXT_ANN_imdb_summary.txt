Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is binary, either 0 or 1, which suggests that the model's output is a binary classification. 

1. The word 'found' appears in 7 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'found' has a significant influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 80.

2. The word 'this' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'this' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'found'. I would rate its importance as 70.

3. The word 'move' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'move' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'found' and 'this'. I would rate its importance as 65.

4. The word 'beautiful' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'beautiful' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'found', 'this', and 'move'. I would rate its importance as 60.

5. The word 'enjoyable' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'enjoyable' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'found', 'this', 'move', and 'beautiful'. I would rate its importance as 55.

6. The word 'uplifting' appears in 5 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'uplifting' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but less than 'found', 'this', 'move', 'beautiful', and 'enjoyable'. I would rate its importance as 50.

7. The word 'i' appears in 8 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'i' has a significant influence on the model's output, but its influence is not as consistent as 'found', 'this', 'move', 'beautiful', 'enjoyable', and 'uplifting'. I would rate its importance as 45.

8. The word ',' appears in 8 instances where the output changes. This suggests that ',' has a significant influence on the model's output, but its influence is not as consistent as 'found', 'this', 'move', 'beautiful', 'enjoyable', 'uplifting', and 'i'. I would rate its importance as 40.

9. The word '.' appears in 5 instances where the output changes. This suggests that '.' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but less than 'found', 'this', 'move', 'beautiful', 'enjoyable', 'uplifting', 'i', and ','. I would rate its importance as 35.

10. The word 'and' appears in 4 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'and' also has a significant influence on the model's output, but less than 'found', 'this', 'move', 'beautiful', 'enjoyable', 'uplifting', 'i', ',', and '.'. I would rate its importance as 30.

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'found', 'this', and 'move'.

found, this, move
