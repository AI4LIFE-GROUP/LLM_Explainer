Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "waste", "money", and "game". 

"Waste" appears in 8 instances where the output changes, indicating a strong influence on the output. It is also present in 4 instances where the output does not change, suggesting that its removal does not always lead to a change in output. However, its frequent appearance in instances where the output changes suggests it has a significant impact. I would rate its importance as 80.

"Money" appears in 4 instances where the output changes, indicating a moderate influence on the output. It is also present in 2 instances where the output does not change, suggesting that its removal does not always lead to a change in output. However, its presence in instances where the output changes suggests it has a significant impact. I would rate its importance as 60.

"Game" appears in 6 instances where the output changes, indicating a strong influence on the output. It is also present in 2 instances where the output does not change, suggesting that its removal does not always lead to a change in output. However, its frequent appearance in instances where the output changes suggests it has a significant impact. I would rate its importance as 70.

The word "your" appears in 7 instances where the output does not change, indicating that it has little to no influence on the output. It is also present in 4 instances where the output changes, but given its frequent appearance in instances where the output does not change, it seems to have less impact. I would rate its importance as 40.

The word "on" appears in 5 instances where the output does not change, indicating that it has little to no influence on the output. It is also present in 4 instances where the output changes, but given its frequent appearance in instances where the output does not change, it seems to have less impact. I would rate its importance as 45.

The word "this" appears in 5 instances where the output does not change, indicating that it has little to no influence on the output. It is also present in 4 instances where the output changes, but given its frequent appearance in instances where the output does not change, it seems to have less impact. I would rate its importance as 45.

Based on this analysis, the final ranking of the words from most important to least important is: waste, game, money, on, this, your.

waste, game, money
