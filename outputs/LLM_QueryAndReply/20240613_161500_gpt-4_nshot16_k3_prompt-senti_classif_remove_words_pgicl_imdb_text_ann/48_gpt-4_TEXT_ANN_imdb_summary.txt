Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'even', 'its', 'sweet', and 'moments'. These words are often removed together and result in a change in output of -1. The word 'has' is removed multiple times but does not seem to affect the output. The word 'sweet' is removed once and does not affect the output. The word '.' is removed once and does not affect the output. The word 'it' is removed once and does not affect the output. 

Based on this, it seems that 'even', 'its', 'sweet', and 'moments' are the most important words, as their removal consistently results in a change in output. The word 'has' is removed multiple times but does not seem to affect the output, suggesting it is less important. The words 'sweet', '.', and 'it' are removed once and do not affect the output, suggesting they are also less important.

Therefore, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is: 'even', 'its', 'sweet', 'moments', 'has', 'sweet', '.', 'it'.

even, its, sweet, moments, has, sweet, ., it
