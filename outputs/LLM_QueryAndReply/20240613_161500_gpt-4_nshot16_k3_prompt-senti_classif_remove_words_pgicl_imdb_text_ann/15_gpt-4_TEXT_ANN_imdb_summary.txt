Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves identifying the words that have the most influence on the model's output. The output changes from 0 to 1 when certain words are removed from the original sentence. 

1. The word 'but' appears in 8 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a significant influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 80.

2. The word 'waiting' appears in 5 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 60.

3. The word 'for' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 65.

4. The word 'their' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 65.

5. The word 'future' appears in 7 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a significant influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 70.

6. The word 'efforts' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 60.

7. The word 'let' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 60.

8. The word 'this' appears in 5 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 55.

9. The word 'one' appears in 6 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 60.

10. The word 'go' appears in 7 instances where the output changes. It seems to have a significant influence on the output. I would rate its importance as 70.

After analyzing all the words, the top three words that seem to have the most influence on the output are 'but', 'future', and 'go'. 

Final Rank: but, future, go.
