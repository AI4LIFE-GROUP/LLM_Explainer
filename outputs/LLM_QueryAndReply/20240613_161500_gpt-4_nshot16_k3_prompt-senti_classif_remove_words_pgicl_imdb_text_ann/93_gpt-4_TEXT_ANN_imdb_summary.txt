Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 (no change) or -1 (a decrease). 

1. 'Beautiful': The removal of 'beautiful' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

2. 'A lot': The removal of 'a lot' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

3. 'Is a lot of .': The removal of 'is a lot of .' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

4. 'Lot': The removal of 'lot' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

5. 'There is a lot beautiful places .': The removal of 'there is a lot beautiful places .' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

6. 'There is lot of beautiful .': The removal of 'there is lot of beautiful .' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

7. 'There is lot': The removal of 'there is lot' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

8. 'Is .': The removal of 'is .' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

9. 'There is a lot of places': The removal of 'there is a lot of places' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

10. 'A of': The removal of 'a of' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

11. 'A': The removal of 'a' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

12. 'Lot .': The removal of 'lot .' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

13. 'There a of beautiful places .': The removal of 'there a of beautiful places .' does not change the output, indicating that it has no influence on the model's output. Importance: 0

14. 'A lot .': The removal of 'a lot .' decreases the output, indicating that it has a negative influence on the model's output. Importance: 100

Based on the above analysis, the words 'a lot', 'lot', 'there is a lot beautiful places .', 'there is lot', 'there is a lot of places', 'lot .', and 'a lot .' are the most important words driving the output as their removal results in a decrease in the output. The words 'beautiful', 'is a lot of .', 'there is lot of beautiful .', 'is .', 'a of', 'a', and 'there a of beautiful places .' are the least important words as their removal does not change the output.

Final Rank: 'a lot', 'lot', 'there is a lot beautiful places .', 'there is lot', 'there is a lot of places', 'lot .', 'a lot .'
