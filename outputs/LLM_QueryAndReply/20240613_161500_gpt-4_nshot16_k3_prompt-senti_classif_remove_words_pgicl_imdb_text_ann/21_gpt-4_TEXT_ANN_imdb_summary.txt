Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows the change in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output of -1 indicates that the removal of the word(s) has a significant impact on the model's output, while a change in output of 0 indicates that the removal of the word(s) has no impact on the model's output.

1. 'finally': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'finally' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

2. 'and': This word appears in all removals, with 8 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 8 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'and' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

3. 'jerry': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'jerry' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

4. 'falwell': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'falwell' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

5. 'competent': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'competent' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

6. 'people': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'people' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

7. 've': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 've' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

8. 'been': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'been' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

9. 'had': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'had' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

10. 'it': This word appears in 8 removals, with 4 resulting in a change in output of -1 and 4 resulting in a change in output of 0. This suggests that 'it' has a moderate impact on the model's output. Importance: 50

Based on the analysis, all the words have the same level of importance in driving the output. Therefore, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is:

finally, and, jerry, falwell, competent, people, ve, been, had, it
