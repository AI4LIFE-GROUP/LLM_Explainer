Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'it', 'looked', and 'wonderful'. 

The word 'it' appears in 7 instances where the output changes, and in 3 instances where the output does not change. This suggests that 'it' has a significant influence on the output, but not in all cases. Therefore, I would rate its importance as 70.

The word 'looked' appears in 5 instances where the output changes, and in 2 instances where the output does not change. This suggests that 'looked' has a strong influence on the output, but not as strong as 'it'. Therefore, I would rate its importance as 60.

The word 'wonderful' appears in 2 instances where the output changes, and does not appear in any instances where the output does not change. This suggests that 'wonderful' has a strong influence on the output when it is present. Therefore, I would rate its importance as 80.

The words 'like', 'a', 'story', and '.' appear in fewer instances where the output changes, and in more instances where the output does not change. This suggests that these words have less influence on the output. Therefore, I would rate their importance as less than 50.

Based on this analysis, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is: wonderful, it, looked, like, a, story, .

wonderful, it, looked
