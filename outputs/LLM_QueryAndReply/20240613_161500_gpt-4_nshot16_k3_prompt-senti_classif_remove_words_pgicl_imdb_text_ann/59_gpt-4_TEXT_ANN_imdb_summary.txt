Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "and", "i", and "funny". 

"And" seems to have a significant impact on the output. Every time it is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that "and" is a key word in the sentence that the model is using to determine the output. 

"I" also seems to have a significant impact on the output. When it is removed along with other words, the output changes by -1. However, when it is removed alone, the output does not change. This suggests that "i" is important in the context of other words, but not on its own.

"funny" is another word that seems to have a significant impact on the output. When it is removed, the output does not change. However, when it is removed along with other words, the output changes by -1. This suggests that "funny" is important in the context of other words, but not on its own.

Based on this analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is: "and", "i", "funny". 

and, i, funny
