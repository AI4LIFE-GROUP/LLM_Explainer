Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves identifying the words that, when removed, cause a change in the model's output. The words that cause a change in output when removed are likely to be the most important words driving the output. 

From the dataset, it can be observed that the removal of certain words or phrases results in a change in output, while the removal of others does not. 

1. The word 'can' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'can' is a significant word. Importance: 70

2. The word 'tolerate' is removed in 6 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'tolerate' is also a significant word. Importance: 70

3. The phrase 'political incorrectness' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'political incorrectness' is a significant phrase. Importance: 70

4. The word 'very' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'very' is a significant word. Importance: 70

5. The word 'well' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'well' is a significant word. Importance: 70

6. The word 'i' is removed in all instances, and in 8 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'i' is a significant word. Importance: 80

7. The word 'm' is removed in all instances, and in 8 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'm' is a significant word. Importance: 80

8. The word 'all' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'all' is a significant word. Importance: 70

9. The word 'for' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'for' is a significant word. Importance: 70

10. The word 'artistic' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'artistic' is a significant word. Importance: 70

11. The word 'freedom' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'freedom' is a significant word. Importance: 70

12. The word 'suspension' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'suspension' is a significant word. Importance: 70

13. The word 'disbelief' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'disbelief' is a significant word. Importance: 70

14. The word 'but' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'but' is a significant word. Importance: 70

15. The word 'the' is removed in all instances, and in 8 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'the' is a significant word. Importance: 80

16. The word 'slavic' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'slavic' is a significant word. Importance: 70

17. The word 'female' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'female' is a significant word. Importance: 70

18. The word 'character' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'character' is a significant word. Importance: 70

19. The word 'was' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'was' is a significant word. Importance: 70

20. The word 'just' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'just' is a significant word. Importance: 70

21. The word 'too' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'too' is a significant word. Importance: 70

22. The word 'much' is removed in 7 instances, and in 4 of those instances, the output changes. This suggests that 'much' is a significant word. Importance: 70

Based on the analysis, the words 'i', 'm', and 'the' are the most important words driving the output.
