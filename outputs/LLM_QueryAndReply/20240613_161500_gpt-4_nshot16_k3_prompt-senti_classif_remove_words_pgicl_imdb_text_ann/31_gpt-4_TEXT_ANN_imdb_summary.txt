Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 (no change) or -1 (negative change). 

1. "The stories": This phrase appears in several removals that result in a change in output of -1. However, it also appears in removals that result in no change. This suggests that the phrase has some importance, but it is not the most critical. Importance: 50

2. "Unbelievable": This word appears in several removals that result in a change in output of -1. However, it also appears in removals that result in no change. This suggests that the word has some importance, but it is not the most critical. Importance: 50

3. "The actors": This phrase appears in several removals that result in a change in output of -1. However, it also appears in removals that result in no change. This suggests that the phrase has some importance, but it is not the most critical. Importance: 50

4. "Were as": This phrase appears in several removals that result in a change in output of -1. However, it also appears in removals that result in no change. This suggests that the phrase has some importance, but it is not the most critical. Importance: 50

5. ".": The removal of this punctuation mark does not result in any change in output. This suggests that it has no importance in determining the output. Importance: 0

Based on the above analysis, the words/phrases "The stories", "Unbelievable", "The actors", and "Were as" are equally important in driving the output, while the punctuation mark "." is not important. 

Final rank: The stories, Unbelievable, The actors, Were as, .
