Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the influence of word removals on the model's output. The output changes from 0 to 1 or vice versa when certain words are removed. The words that cause a change in output when removed are considered important. 

1. 'Co-stars': This word appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'co-stars' is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 90

2. 'Don': This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'don' is also a significant word in determining the output, but slightly less so than 'co-stars'. Importance: 80

3. 'Freeman': This word appears in 4 instances where the output changes. This suggests that 'freeman' is also a significant word in determining the output, but less so than 'co-stars' and 'don'. Importance: 70

4. 'T': This word appears in 7 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 60

5. 'Much': This word appears in 4 instances where the output changes. However, like 't', it is a common word and its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 50

6. 'Better': This word appears in 4 instances where the output changes. However, like 't' and 'much', it is a common word and its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 40

7. 'With': This word appears in 4 instances where the output changes. However, like 't', 'much', and 'better', it is a common word and its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 30

8. 'Like': This word appears in 3 instances where the output changes. However, like the other common words, its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 20

9. 'Jonah': This word appears in 2 instances where the output changes. However, its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 10

10. 'Hill': This word appears in 2 instances where the output changes. However, its removal might not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, its importance is lower. Importance: 5

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'co-stars', 'don', and 'freeman'.

Co-stars, Don, Freeman
