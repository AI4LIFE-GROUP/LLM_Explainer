Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the importance of words in driving the output of a model. The output changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The change in output is either 1 or 0, with 1 indicating a significant change and 0 indicating no change. 

1. "excellent": This word appears in almost all the removed words list. When it is removed, the output changes significantly in most cases, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 80.

2. "drama": This word appears in many of the removed words list. Its removal often leads to a significant change in output, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 70.

3. "thriller": This word appears in many of the removed words list. Its removal often leads to a significant change in output, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 70.

4. "film": This word appears in many of the removed words list. Its removal often leads to a significant change in output, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 70.

5. "it": This word appears in many of the removed words list. Its removal often leads to a significant change in output, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 60.

6. "is": This word appears in many of the removed words list. Its removal often leads to a significant change in output, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 60.

7. "an": This word appears in many of the removed words list. Its removal often leads to a significant change in output, indicating a strong positive correlation. However, there are also instances where its removal does not change the output, indicating a negative correlation. Considering both, I would rate its importance as 60.

Based on the above analysis, the final rank from most important to least important is:

excellent, drama, thriller, film, it, is, an.
