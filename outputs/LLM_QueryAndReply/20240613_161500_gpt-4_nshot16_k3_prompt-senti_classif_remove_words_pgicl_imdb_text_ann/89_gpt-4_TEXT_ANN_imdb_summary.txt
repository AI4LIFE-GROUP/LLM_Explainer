Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows the change in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output of 0 means the removal of the word(s) did not affect the model's output, while a change of -1 means the removal of the word(s) did affect the model's output. 

1. 'What': This word was removed in 8 instances, and in all of these instances, the change in output was -1. This suggests that 'what' is a significant word in driving the output. Importance: 100

2. 'The': This word was removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 4, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'the' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what'. Importance: 50

3. 'Hell': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'hell' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

4. 'Kind': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'kind' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

5. 'Of': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'of' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

6. 'Crap': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'crap' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

7. 'Is': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'is' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

8. 'That': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that 'that' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

9. '?': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that '?' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

10. '!': This word was removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the change in output was -1, and in the other 3, the change in output was 0. This suggests that '!' has some influence on the output, but not as much as 'what' or 'the'. Importance: 50

Based on the analysis, the word 'what' is the most important in driving the output, followed by 'the', 'hell', 'kind', 'of', 'crap', 'is', 'that', '?', '!'. 

Answer: What, The, Hell
