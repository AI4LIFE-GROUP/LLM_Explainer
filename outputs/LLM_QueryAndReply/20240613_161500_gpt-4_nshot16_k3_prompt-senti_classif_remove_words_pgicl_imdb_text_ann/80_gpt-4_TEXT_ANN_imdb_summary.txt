Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the influence of word removals on the model's output. The output changes between 0 and -1, with 0 indicating no change and -1 indicating a negative change. 

1. The word "***spoilers***" appears in 10 out of 16 removals. In all these cases, the output change is either 0 or -1. This suggests that the word "***spoilers***" does not have a significant impact on the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be low, around 20.

2. The word "can" appears in 8 out of 16 removals. In all these cases, the output change is either 0 or -1. This suggests that the word "can" has a moderate impact on the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be moderate, around 50.

3. The word "else" appears in 7 out of 16 removals. In all these cases, the output change is either 0 or -1. This suggests that the word "else" has a significant impact on the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be high, around 70.

4. The word "surface" appears in 6 out of 16 removals. In all these cases, the output change is either 0 or -1. This suggests that the word "surface" has a significant impact on the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be high, around 80.

5. The word "crafted" appears in 5 out of 16 removals. In all these cases, the output change is either 0 or -1. This suggests that the word "crafted" has a significant impact on the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be high, around 90.

Based on the above analysis, the running rank of the words from most important to least important would be: crafted, surface, else, can, ***spoilers***.

Final Answer: crafted, surface, else.
