Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'funny', 'clever', and 'hip'. These words are consistently removed in the instances where the output changes. 

1. 'Funny': This word is removed in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that it has a significant impact on the output. Rating: 90

2. 'Clever': This word is removed in 5 instances where the output changes. This suggests that it also has a significant impact on the output, but slightly less than 'funny'. Rating: 80

3. 'Hip': This word is removed in 5 instances where the output changes. This suggests that it also has a significant impact on the output, but slightly less than 'funny' and 'clever'. Rating: 70

Comparing these three words, 'funny' seems to be the most important, followed by 'clever' and then 'hip'. Other words like 'pray', 'previous', 'film', 'hype', and 'like' are also removed in instances where the output changes, but they are removed less frequently than 'funny', 'clever', and 'hip'. Therefore, they are likely less important in driving the output.

Final rank: Funny, Clever, Hip
