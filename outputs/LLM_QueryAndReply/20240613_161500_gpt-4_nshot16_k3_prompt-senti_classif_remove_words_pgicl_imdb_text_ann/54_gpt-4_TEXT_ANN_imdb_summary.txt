Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'a', 'film', 'not', 'forgotten', and '.' are removed. However, the output does not change when the words 'easily' are removed. This suggests that 'easily' is not as important in driving the output as the other words. 

The word 'a' seems to have a significant impact on the output, as removing it always results in a change in output. The same can be said for 'forgotten' and '.'. 

The word 'film' also seems to have a significant impact on the output, but not as much as 'a', 'forgotten', and '.'. This is because removing 'film' sometimes results in a change in output and sometimes does not. 

The word 'not' seems to have the least impact on the output, as removing it never results in a change in output. 

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'a', 'forgotten', and '.'. 

Final Rank: a, forgotten, .
