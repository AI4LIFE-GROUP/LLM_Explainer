Question: "Based on the model's predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top four most important features in determining the model's prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top four most important features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
Reasoning: The model seems to be predicting negative outputs (-1) when there is an increase in features A and D, and a decrease in features B and C. For positive outputs (0), it appears that the model is correlating these with a decrease in feature A, and an increase in features B, C, and D. Therefore, without specific weights given to each feature by the model, we can surmise that all four features add critical information to the model. 

Answer: A, B, C, D
