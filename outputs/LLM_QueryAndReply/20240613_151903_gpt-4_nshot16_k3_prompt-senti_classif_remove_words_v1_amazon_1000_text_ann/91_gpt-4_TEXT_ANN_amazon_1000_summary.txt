Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Reasoning: The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be inferred by observing the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word causes a change in the model's output, it suggests that the word is important for the model's prediction. 

From the dataset, we can see that the removal of the word 'pretty' consistently results in a change in output, suggesting that it is an important word for the model's prediction. Similarly, the removal of the words 'piece' and 'junk' does not result in a change in output, suggesting that these words are less important for the model's prediction. 

However, the removal of the word 'of' does not consistently result in a change in output. This suggests that the word 'of' may be of intermediate importance for the model's prediction. 

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are 'pretty', 'of', and 'piece'.

Answer: pretty, of, piece
