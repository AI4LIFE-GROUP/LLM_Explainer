Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes to -1 only when all the words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that the model's prediction is not significantly influenced by the removal of any specific word or group of words. However, if we were to infer the importance of words based on their frequency in the removed words list, the words 'the', 'that', and 'was' appear most frequently. 

Answer: the, that, was
