Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Reasoning: The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be inferred by observing the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word consistently leads to a change in output, it can be considered important. From the dataset, it appears that the words 'this', 'battery', and 'excellent' are the most important. Whenever these words are removed, the output changes, indicating that they have a significant influence on the model's prediction.

Answer: this, battery, excellent
