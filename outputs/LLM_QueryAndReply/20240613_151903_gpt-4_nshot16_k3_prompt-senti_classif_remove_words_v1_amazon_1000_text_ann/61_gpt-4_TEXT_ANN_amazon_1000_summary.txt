Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. By comparing the sentences where the output changes with those where it doesn't, we can identify the words that seem to have the most impact on the model's prediction. 

The words 'overly', 'expensive', and 'replace' appear to be significant. In most cases where the output changes, these words are removed. Conversely, when these words are present, the output tends to remain the same. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction.

overly, expensive, replace
