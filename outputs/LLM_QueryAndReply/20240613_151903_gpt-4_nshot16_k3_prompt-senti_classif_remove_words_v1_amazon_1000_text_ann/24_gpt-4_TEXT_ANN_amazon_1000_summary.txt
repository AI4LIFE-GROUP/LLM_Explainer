Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes by -1 when the words "warning", "do", and "not" are removed. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. When other words are removed, the change in output is 0, indicating that these words do not significantly influence the model's prediction. Therefore, the top three most important words appear to be "warning", "do", and "not".

Answer: warning, do, not
