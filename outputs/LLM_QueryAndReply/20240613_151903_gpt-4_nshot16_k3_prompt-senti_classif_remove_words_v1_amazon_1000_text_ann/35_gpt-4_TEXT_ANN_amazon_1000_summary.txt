Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes by -1 whenever the words 'krussel', 'always', and 'good' are removed, either individually or in combination. This suggests that these three words are the most important in determining the model's prediction. However, when 'krussel' is removed, the output does not change, suggesting that 'krussel' might be less important than 'always' and 'good'. 

always, good, krussel
