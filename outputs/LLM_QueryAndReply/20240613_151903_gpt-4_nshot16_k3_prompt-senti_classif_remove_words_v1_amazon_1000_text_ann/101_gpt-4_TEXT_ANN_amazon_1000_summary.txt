Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be inferred by looking at the words that, when removed, cause a change in the model's output. In this case, the words 'my', 'has', and 'she' seem to be the most important. These words are present in most of the sentences where their removal causes a change in output. 

Answer: my, has, she
