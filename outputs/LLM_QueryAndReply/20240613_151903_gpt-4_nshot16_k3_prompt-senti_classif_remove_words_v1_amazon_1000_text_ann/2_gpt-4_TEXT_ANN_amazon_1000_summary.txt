Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes by -1 every time the entire sentence "customer service was terrible" is removed. However, when individual words or combinations of words are removed, the output remains the same. This suggests that the model is considering the entire sentence as a single entity for its prediction. 

However, if we were to rank the words based on their frequency of appearance in the 'Removed words' column, the top three words would be 'customer', 'service', and 'was'. This is because these words appear more frequently than 'terrible'. But this does not necessarily mean that these words are the most important in determining the model's prediction. 

Given the data, it's difficult to definitively determine the top three most important words in the model's prediction. The model seems to be considering the entire sentence rather than individual words for its prediction. 

Customer, Service, Was
