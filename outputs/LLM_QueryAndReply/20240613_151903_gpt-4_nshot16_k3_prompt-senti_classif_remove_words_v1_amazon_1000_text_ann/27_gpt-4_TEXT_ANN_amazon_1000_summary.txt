Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. By comparing the removed words in each case, we can identify the words that, when removed, cause a change in the model's output. 

The word 'good' appears in every instance where the output changes from 1 to 0. This suggests that 'good' is a key word in determining the model's prediction. 

The word 'price' also appears frequently in the instances where the output changes from 1 to 0. This suggests that 'price' is another important word for the model's prediction.

The word 'the' also appears frequently in the instances where the output changes from 1 to 0. However, it is a common word and appears in almost all sentences, so its importance might be less than 'good' and 'price'.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction appear to be 'good', 'price', and 'the'.

good, price, the
