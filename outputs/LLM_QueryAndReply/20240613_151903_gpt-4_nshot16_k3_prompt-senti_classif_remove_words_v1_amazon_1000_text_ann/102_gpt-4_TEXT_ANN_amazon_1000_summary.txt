Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The words that cause a change in output when removed are likely to be the most important words in determining the model's prediction. 

By analyzing the dataset, we can see that the words 'drawback', 'skip', and 'lock' are common in the sentences where the output changes from 0 to -1. These words are not present in the sentences where the output remains 0 after word removal. Therefore, it can be inferred that these words are significant in determining the model's prediction.

Answer: drawback, skip, lock
