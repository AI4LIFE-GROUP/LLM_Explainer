Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes by -1 only when the entire phrase "waste of money" is removed. This suggests that the model is considering the entire phrase as a single entity rather than individual words. However, if we were to rank the individual words based on their importance, we would consider the words that, when removed, do not change the model's output. This is because the model's prediction remains the same even without these words, indicating that they are not crucial for the prediction. Based on this reasoning, the words "waste", "of", and "." seem to be the least important as their removal does not change the model's output.

Answer: waste, of, .
