Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Reasoning: The model's output changes from 0 to 1 when the words 'voice', 'quality', and 'dropped' are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. When these words are present, the model's output is 0, and when they are removed, the model's output changes to 1. Therefore, these words seem to have a significant influence on the model's output.

Answer: voice, quality, dropped
