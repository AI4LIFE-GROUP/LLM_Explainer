Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes every time a word is removed from the original sentence. However, some words seem to have a more significant impact on the model's output than others. The words 'don', 'think', and 'would' appear to be the most important in determining the model's prediction. This is because every time these words are removed, the model's output changes. 

Answer: don, think, would
