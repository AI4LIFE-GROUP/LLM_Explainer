Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The question asks for the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction. To answer this, we need to look at the words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output. 

Looking at the dataset, it's clear that the removal of certain words consistently leads to a change in output. These words are 'communication', 'data', and 'management'. In every instance where these words are removed, the output changes. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction.

Therefore, the top three most important words, in descending order, are:

communication, data, management
