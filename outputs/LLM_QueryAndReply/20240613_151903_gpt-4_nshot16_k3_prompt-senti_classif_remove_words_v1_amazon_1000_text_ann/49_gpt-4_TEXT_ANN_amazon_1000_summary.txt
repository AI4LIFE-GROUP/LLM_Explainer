Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The words that cause a change in output when removed are likely to be the most important words in determining the model's prediction. 

From the dataset, it appears that the words 'difficult', 'i', and 'avoiding' are the most important. When these words are removed, the output changes from the original. For example, when 'difficult' and 'i' are removed, the output changes by -1. Similarly, when 'avoiding' is removed, the output also changes by -1. 

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, in descending order, are 'difficult', 'i', and 'avoiding'.

difficult, i, avoiding
