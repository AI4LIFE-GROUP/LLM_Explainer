Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes when the words "poor", "quality", and "poor quality" are removed. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. The word "sound" and the punctuation "." do not seem to affect the model's output when removed, indicating they are less important. 

Among the important words, "poor" and "quality" both individually and together as "poor quality" influence the model's output. However, the word "poor" seems to have a more consistent impact on the model's output as it changes the output every time it is removed, whether alone or in combination with "quality". Therefore, "poor" is likely the most important word, followed by "quality". 

Answer: poor, quality
