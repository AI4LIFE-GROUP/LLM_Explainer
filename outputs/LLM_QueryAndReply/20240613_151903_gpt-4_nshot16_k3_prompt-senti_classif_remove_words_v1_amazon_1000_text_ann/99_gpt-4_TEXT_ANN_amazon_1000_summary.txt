Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. By comparing the removed words in the cases where the output changes, we can identify the words that seem to have the most influence on the model's prediction. 

The words 'contacted', 'company', and 'told' appear in almost all instances where the change in output is -1. This suggests that these words are significant in determining the model's output. When these words are removed, the model's output changes, indicating their importance.

Answer: contacted, company, told
