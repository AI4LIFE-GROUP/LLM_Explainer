Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be inferred by looking at the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word causes a significant change in the output, it can be considered important. 

In this dataset, the removal of the words "-", "i", and "'" consistently results in a change in output from 0 to -1. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. 

On the other hand, the removal of words like "m", "giving", "up", and "unreliable" does not seem to affect the output, suggesting that these words are less important.

Answer: -, i, '
