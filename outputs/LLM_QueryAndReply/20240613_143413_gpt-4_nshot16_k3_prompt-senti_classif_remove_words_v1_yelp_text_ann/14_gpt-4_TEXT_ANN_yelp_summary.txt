Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Reasoning: The model's output changes every time a word is removed from the sentence. However, some words seem to have a more significant impact on the model's output than others. For instance, every time the word "also" is removed, the model's output changes. The same pattern is observed with the words "staff" and "efficient". These words seem to be the most important in determining the model's prediction.

Answer: also, staff, efficient
