Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be identified by observing the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word or a set of words consistently leads to a change in output, it can be inferred that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. 

In the given dataset, the words 'disgusted', 'because', and 'sure' seem to be the most important. Whenever these words are removed from the sentence, the output changes. For instance, when 'disgusted' is removed, the output changes in 6 out of 7 instances. Similarly, when 'because' is removed, the output changes in 5 out of 6 instances. Lastly, when 'sure' is removed, the output changes in 4 out of 5 instances. 

Therefore, based on the frequency of output changes upon their removal, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction appear to be 'disgusted', 'because', and 'sure'.

disgusted, because, sure
