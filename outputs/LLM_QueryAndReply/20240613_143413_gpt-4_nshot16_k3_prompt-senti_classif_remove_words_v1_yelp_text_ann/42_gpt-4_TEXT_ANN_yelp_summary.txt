Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be identified by looking at the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word causes a change in output, it suggests that the word is important for the model's prediction. 

In this dataset, every time the words "we", "were", and "promptly" are removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that these words are important for the model's prediction. 

On the other hand, the removal of other words such as "greeted", "and", "seated", and "." does not cause a change in output, suggesting that these words are not as important.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, in descending order, are "we", "were", and "promptly".

we, were, promptly
