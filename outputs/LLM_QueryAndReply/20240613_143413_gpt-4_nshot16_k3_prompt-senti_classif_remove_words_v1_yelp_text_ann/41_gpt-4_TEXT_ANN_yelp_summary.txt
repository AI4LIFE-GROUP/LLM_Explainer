Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The dataset shows that regardless of the words removed from the original sentence, the change in output remains the same (0). This suggests that no single word in the sentence has a significant influence on the model's prediction. Therefore, it's not possible to rank the words based on their importance in determining the model's prediction.

Answer: Not applicable.
