REPLY:
The model's output changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. By looking at the dataset, we can see that the model's output changes when the words 'fries', 'good', and 'seasoned' are removed. Therefore, these words seem to be the most important in determining the model's prediction.

Answer: fries, good, seasoned
