REPLY:
The model's output changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. By analyzing the dataset, we can see that the removal of the words 'pepper', 'beef', and 'sandwich' often results in a change in the model's output. Therefore, these words seem to be the most important in determining the model's prediction.

Pepper, Beef, Sandwich
