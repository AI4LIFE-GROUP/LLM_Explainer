REPLY:
The model's prediction changes when certain words are removed from the sentence. This indicates that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. The words that cause a change in output when removed are 't', 'better', and 'isn'. These words appear to be the most important in determining the model's prediction as their removal consistently results in a change in output.

Answer: 't, better, isn
