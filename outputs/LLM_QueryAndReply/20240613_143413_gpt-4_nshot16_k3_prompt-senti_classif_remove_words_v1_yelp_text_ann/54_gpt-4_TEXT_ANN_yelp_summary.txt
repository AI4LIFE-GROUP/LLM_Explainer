Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to be influenced by the presence or absence of certain words. When these words are removed, the output changes. The words that seem to have the most impact are those that are consistently present in the "Removed words" when the "Change in output" is -1. These words are "hot", "cold", and "gloves". 

hot, cold, gloves
