Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. The words that appear to have the most influence on the model's prediction are "not", "be", and "getting". These words are common in the removed words when the output changes from 1 to 0. This suggests that the presence of these words in the sentence is important for the model to predict a 1. When these words are removed, the model's prediction changes to 0, indicating that these words are significant in the model's decision-making process.

not, be, getting
