Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Reasoning: The model's output changes every time a word is removed from the sentence. This suggests that each word has some influence on the model's prediction. However, some words appear more frequently in the 'Removed words' column when the output changes. These words are likely to be more important in determining the model's prediction. 

By analyzing the dataset, the words 'and', 'disappointed', and 'ate' appear most frequently in the 'Removed words' column when the output changes. Therefore, these words are likely to be the most important in determining the model's prediction.

Answer: and, disappointed, ate
