Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be inferred by looking at the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word causes a change in output, it suggests that the word is important for the model's prediction. 

From the dataset, it can be seen that the removal of the words 'patio', 'seating', and 'comfortable' consistently results in a change in output. This suggests that these words are the most important in determining the model's prediction. 

Answer: patio, seating, comfortable
