Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be inferred by looking at the changes in output when certain words are removed. If the removal of a word causes a change in output, it suggests that the word is important for the model's prediction. 

From the dataset, it appears that the words 'excellent', 'good', and 'service' are the most important. This is because when these words are removed, the output changes. For example, when 'excellent' is removed in the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh datasets, the output changes. Similarly, when 'good' is removed in the first, fourth, seventh, tenth, and thirteenth datasets, the output changes. Lastly, when 'service' is removed in the first, fourth, eighth, and tenth datasets, the output changes. 

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are 'excellent', 'good', and 'service'.

excellent, good, service
