Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction seem to be those that, when removed, cause a change in the output. In this case, the words that cause a change in output when removed are "never", "will", and "dining". 

These words are likely important because they contribute significantly to the overall sentiment of the sentence. "Never" indicates a strong negative sentiment, "will" indicates a future action, and "dining" is the main action being discussed. 

Therefore, the top three most important words, in descending order, are:

never, will, dining
