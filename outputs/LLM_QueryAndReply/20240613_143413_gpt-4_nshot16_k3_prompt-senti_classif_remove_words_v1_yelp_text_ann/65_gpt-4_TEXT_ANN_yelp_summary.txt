Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be identified by looking at the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word results in a change in output, it suggests that the word is important for the model's prediction. 

In this dataset, the removal of the words 'the live music on totally blows .', 'music totally .', 'the live music on fridays totally', 'the live music', 'the on totally .', 'the live on fridays totally blows .', 'the live music on fridays totally blows', and 'the live on totally' all result in a change in output. 

However, these phrases contain multiple words, so we need to identify the individual words that are causing the change in output. By comparing these phrases, we can see that the words 'the', 'live', and 'music' are common in all of them. Therefore, these are likely the most important words in determining the model's prediction.

the, live, music
