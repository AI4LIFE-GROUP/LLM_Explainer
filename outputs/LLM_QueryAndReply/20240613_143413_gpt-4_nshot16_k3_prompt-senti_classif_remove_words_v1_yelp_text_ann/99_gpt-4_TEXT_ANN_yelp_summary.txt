Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. 

Looking at the dataset, the words 'promise', 'fails', and 'deliver' seem to be the most important. In most cases, when these words are removed, the model's output changes. For example, when 'promise' is removed, the output changes in 5 out of 6 cases. Similarly, when 'fails' is removed, the output changes in 6 out of 7 cases. Lastly, when 'deliver' is removed, the output changes in 5 out of 6 cases. 

Therefore, based on the frequency of change in output when these words are removed, it can be inferred that 'promise', 'fails', and 'deliver' are the most important words in determining the model's prediction.

promise, fails, deliver
