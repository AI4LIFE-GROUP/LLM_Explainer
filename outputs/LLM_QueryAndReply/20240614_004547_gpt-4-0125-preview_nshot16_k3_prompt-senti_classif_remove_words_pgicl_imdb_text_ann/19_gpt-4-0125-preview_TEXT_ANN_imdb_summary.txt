Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of specific words being removed on the change in output. We'll focus on words that appear multiple times across different removals and their correlation with the change in output (either 1 or 0).

1. **'gross'** - Appears in several removals with varying outputs. Its removal doesn't consistently lead to a specific output change, indicating its influence might be moderate but not decisive. Importance: 50

2. **'not'** - The removal of 'not' seems to have a more consistent correlation with the change in output. When 'not' is removed, the output tends to be 0, suggesting its presence or absence significantly influences the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment. Importance: 80

3. **'chills'** - Similar to 'gross', 'chills' appears in multiple removals. However, its removal and the corresponding output change do not show a strong consistent pattern, suggesting its impact is present but not as strong as 'not'. Importance: 60

4. **'great'** - The word 'great' appears in several removals, and its absence often correlates with a change in output to 0, indicating its positive influence on the model's output. Importance: 70

5. **'want'** - Appears frequently but does not show a strong correlation with either output consistently, suggesting its role is more about sentence structure than sentiment. Importance: 40

6. **'movie'** - Similar to 'want', 'movie' appears often but does not have a consistent impact on the output change, indicating its importance is more related to the context rather than sentiment. Importance: 30

7. **'but'** - The word 'but' might play a role in contrasting ideas within the sentence, yet its removal doesn't consistently lead to one specific output, suggesting a moderate influence. Importance: 45

Ranking the words based on their importance in determining the output, considering both their positive and negative correlations, we get:

**not, great, chills, gross, but, want, movie**

Therefore, the top three most important words driving the output are:

not, great, chills
