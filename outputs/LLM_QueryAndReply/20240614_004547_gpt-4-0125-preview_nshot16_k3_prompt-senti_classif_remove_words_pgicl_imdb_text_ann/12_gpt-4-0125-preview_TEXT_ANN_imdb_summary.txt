Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the importance of each word in driving the output, we'll analyze the changes in output when each word is removed. A change in output indicates the word's importance in the original sentence's sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model. 

1. **"so"** - Removal of "so" consistently results in a change in output (-1), indicating its importance in maintaining the positive sentiment of the original sentence. Its removal leads to a negative shift, suggesting it amplifies the sentiment. **Importance: 90**

2. **"awesome"** - The removal of "awesome" sometimes leads to no change and sometimes is part of combinations where its removal doesn't uniquely identify its impact due to the presence of other words. However, considering "awesome" is a key adjective that directly contributes to the positive sentiment, its importance is significant but not as critical as "so" in isolation. **Importance: 80**

3. **"this"** - The removal of "this" shows no change when removed alone but contributes to a negative change when removed with other words. Its role seems more about sentence structure than sentiment. **Importance: 30**

4. **"movie"** - Similar to "this," "movie" does not independently affect the output when removed but does contribute to a change when removed with other words. Its importance is slightly less than "this" because it is a subject noun and does not contribute to sentiment directly. **Importance: 25**

5. **"is"** - The removal of "is" shows a consistent negative change, indicating its structural importance in the sentence. However, since its removal always results in a negative change, it suggests that "is" plays a crucial role in maintaining the sentence's positive sentiment by being part of its grammatical structure. **Importance: 70**

6. **"!"** - The exclamation mark's removal sometimes leads to no change and is not directly tested alone. Its role is more about intensifying sentiment rather than changing it. **Importance: 40**

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the output, considering both their presence and absence, are:

**so, is, awesome**
