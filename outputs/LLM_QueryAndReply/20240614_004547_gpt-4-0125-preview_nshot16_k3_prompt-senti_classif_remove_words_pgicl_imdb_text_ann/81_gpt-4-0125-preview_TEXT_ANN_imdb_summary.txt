Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of removal of specific words on the change in output. We'll focus on words that appear multiple times across different contexts for removal, observing both when their removal leads to a change in output to 1 and when it leads to a change in output to 0.

1. **Insult** - The word "insult" is directly removed in one instance, leading to a change in output to 0. This indicates a strong negative correlation with the output when removed, suggesting its presence is crucial for a specific output (likely negative sentiment). Importance: 90

2. **Film** - Removed in several instances, leading to both changes in output to 1 and 0. Its removal doesn't consistently lead to the same change in output, indicating its influence is significant but not as pivotal as "insult" for determining sentiment. Importance: 70

3. **Public** - Similar to "film," its removal is seen in contexts leading to both outputs 1 and 0. However, its direct impact seems less critical compared to "insult" and "film," as it's more about the target of the insult rather than the sentiment itself. Importance: 60

4. **And** - The word "and" is removed multiple times, with changes leading to both 1 and 0 in output. Its role seems more structural than influential in sentiment analysis, suggesting a lower importance in driving output compared to "insult," "film," and "public." Importance: 50

5. **This** - Its removal leads to changes in output, but like "and," it seems to play a more structural role in the sentence. Its impact on sentiment or the output's change is less direct than the words above. Importance: 40

6. **Loosely** - Mentioned in several removals, but its direct impact on the change in output is not as clear as "insult." It seems to modify the sentiment but is not a key driver on its own. Importance: 30

7. **Movie-going** - Appears in contexts of both outputs but seems to be part of the phrase "movie-going public," thus its importance is tied to the context rather than the word itself driving sentiment. Importance: 20

8. **I** - Mostly structural, with its removal not clearly tied to changes in output in a way that suggests it's a key driver of sentiment. Importance: 10

9. **Use** - Similar to "I," it's part of a phrase that's removed but doesn't directly influence the output in a significant way on its own. Importance: 5

Ranking the words based on the analysis above, from most important to least important, we get:

**Insult, Film, Public, And, This, Loosely, Movie-going, I, Use**
