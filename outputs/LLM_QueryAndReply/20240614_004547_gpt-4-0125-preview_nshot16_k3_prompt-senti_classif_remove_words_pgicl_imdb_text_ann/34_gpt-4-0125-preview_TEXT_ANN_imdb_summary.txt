Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. We'll consider how often the removal of a word or combination of words leads to a change in output, and whether the presence of certain words in the removed phrases consistently correlates with a specific change in output.

1. **Unique**: The word "unique" is removed in several instances, often alongside other words. Whenever "unique" is removed, especially with "feeling" and "though," there's a consistent change in output to -1. This suggests a strong correlation between the presence of "unique" and the model's output. Its removal, particularly in combinations that lead to a negative change, highlights its importance. Importance: 90

2. **Feeling**: This word, similar to "unique," appears in combinations that lead to a -1 change in output. Its removal, especially alongside "unique" and "though," indicates it plays a significant role in the model's output. However, since "unique" and "feeling" often appear together in changes, it's slightly less clear if "feeling" alone has as strong an impact as "unique" or if its impact is more due to the combination. Importance: 80

3. **Though**: The word "though" is also removed in several instances, often with "unique" and "feeling." Its removal is associated with a change in output to -1 in multiple cases. However, its removal alone or in different combinations doesn't consistently lead to a change, suggesting its importance is somewhat contextual and not as strong as "unique" or "feeling." Importance: 70

4. **Really**: The removal of "really" in various combinations leads to both 0 and -1 changes in output. However, its impact seems less direct compared to "unique," "feeling," or "though." The changes are more varied, suggesting its role is more supportive in the sentence's sentiment or meaning rather than critical. Importance: 60

5. **Created**: The word "created" is removed in several instances, but its removal alone leads to a 0 change in output, and it's often part of phrases where its absence doesn't directly correlate with the -1 change. This suggests "created" has a lesser impact on the model's output compared to the other words analyzed. Importance: 50

6. **It**: The removal of "it" alone or in combination doesn't consistently lead to a negative change in output. Its role seems to be more about sentence structure than influencing the model's sentiment or meaning directly. Importance: 40

7. **A**: Similar to "it," the removal of "a" is part of larger phrases and doesn't show a direct correlation with changes in output on its own. Its impact is minimal and more related to sentence structure. Importance: 30

Based on the analysis, the final rank from most important to least important is:

unique, feeling, though, really, created, it, a
