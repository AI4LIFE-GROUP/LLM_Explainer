Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze each word's presence or absence in the dataset and its impact on the change in output. We'll consider how the removal of specific words or combinations thereof affects the model's output, focusing on patterns that indicate a word's influence.

1. **"not"**: Appears frequently in combinations that lead to both 0 and -1 changes in output. Its removal in various contexts seems to influence the output significantly, suggesting it plays a crucial role in the sentence's sentiment or meaning as perceived by the model. Importance: 90

2. **"too"**: Also appears frequently, often in conjunction with "not". Its removal, especially alongside "not", tends to lead to a change in output, indicating its role in modifying the sentence's tone or intensity. Importance: 80

3. **"screamy"**: Its removal in certain combinations leads to a -1 change, but its effect is less consistent compared to "not" and "too". It seems to contribute to the sentence's overall sentiment but is less pivotal on its own. Importance: 60

4. **"masculine"**: The removal of "masculine" in different contexts leads to both 0 and -1 changes. It appears to have a specific impact when removed alongside certain words, suggesting a moderate level of importance in influencing the model's output. Importance: 70

5. **"but"**: Its removal does not consistently lead to a change in output, indicating that while it may contribute to the sentence's structure, it's less influential on the model's output decision. Importance: 50

6. **"right"**: Similar to "but", its removal shows some influence on the output change, but it's not as significant or consistent as "not", "too", or "masculine". Importance: 55

7. **"to"**: This word appears in various combinations, but its removal's impact seems less direct or significant compared to more content-heavy words like "not" or "masculine". Importance: 40

8. **"just"**: Its presence or absence does not significantly alter the output in most cases, suggesting it has the least impact on the model's interpretation of the sentence. Importance: 30

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, considering their influence both in terms of presence and absence, are:

not, too, masculine
