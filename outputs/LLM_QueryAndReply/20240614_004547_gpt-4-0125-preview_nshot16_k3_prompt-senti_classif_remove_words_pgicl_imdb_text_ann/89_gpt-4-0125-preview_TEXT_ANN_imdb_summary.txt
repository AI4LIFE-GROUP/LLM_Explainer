Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we need to analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. The dataset shows changes in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output of -1 indicates a negative impact, while a change of 0 indicates no impact. 

1. **What**: Appears in multiple removals with both -1 and 0 changes. Its presence or absence alone doesn't consistently drive the output to change, suggesting its importance is moderate but not critical.

2. **The**: Similar to "what," it appears in various combinations, leading to both -1 and 0 changes. Its impact seems to be diluted and dependent on the combination with other words, indicating a moderate level of importance.

3. **Hell**: The removal of "hell" in combinations leads to both outcomes, but it's not the sole driver. Its importance seems to be on the lower side compared to others that directly influence the output when removed.

4. **Kind**: Present in multiple combinations leading to changes. However, its removal, along with specific other words (like "is" or "that"), tends to be part of the combinations that result in -1, suggesting a higher importance.

5. **Crap**: Similar to "kind," its presence or absence in combinations that lead to a change in output suggests it has a significant impact on the model's output, indicating a high level of importance.

6. **Is**: The word "is" appears in combinations that lead to both -1 and 0 changes. Its removal, especially in combinations without "kind" or "crap," doesn't always result in a negative change, suggesting its importance is conditional but notable.

7. **That**: The removal of "that" in various combinations leads to both outcomes. However, like "is," its impact seems conditional, making it moderately important.

8. **?!**: The punctuation marks seem to have a negligible direct impact on the change in output when considered without key words, suggesting their importance is minimal in the context of word removal.

Based on the analysis, the words that appear most frequently in combinations leading to a change in output (-1) and are part of the critical combinations are "kind," "crap," and "is." These words, when removed in certain combinations, consistently contribute to a negative change in output, indicating their high importance in driving the model's output.

Final rank of words from most important to least important: **crap, kind, is**.
