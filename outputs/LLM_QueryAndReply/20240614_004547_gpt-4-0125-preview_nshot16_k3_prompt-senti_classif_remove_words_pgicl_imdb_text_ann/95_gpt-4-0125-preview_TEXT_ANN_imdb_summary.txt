Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences of each word in relation to the change in output. We'll focus on the words that appear in the "Removed words" list and their corresponding impact on the output change. The words that stand out based on their frequency in the dataset and their presence in sentences with output changes are "every", "kind", and "length".

1. **Every**: This word appears in several instances where its removal leads to a change in output, both positive and negative. Its removal seems to significantly alter the sentiment or meaning captured by the model, indicating a strong influence on the output. Given its consistent impact across different removals, we rate its importance highly.

2. **Kind**: Similar to "every", "kind" appears multiple times across the dataset. However, its removal doesn't always lead to a change in output, suggesting that while it has an impact, it might be context-dependent or not as universally influential on the model's interpretation of the sentence. Thus, its importance is notable but not as critical as "every".

3. **Length**: The word "length" is interesting because its removal in some contexts leads to a negative change in output, but it's not as consistently impactful as "every". It seems to play a role in the model's understanding of the sentence, particularly in relation to the movie's duration, but its influence is somewhat less compared to "every" and "kind".

Ranking these words based on their importance in determining the output, considering both their positive and negative impacts, we get:

1. **Every**: Its removal consistently affects the output, indicating a strong influence.
2. **Kind**: Has a noticeable impact but less consistently than "every".
3. **Length**: Influences the output, especially in contexts related to the movie's characteristics, but its overall impact is less than "every" and "kind".

Final Rank: every, kind, length
