Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, let's analyze the words that appear frequently across different removals and their impact on the change in output. The words we'll focus on are "lewis", "black", and "pg-13", as these words are prominently featured in the dataset and their removal seems to have a significant impact on the output.

1. **Lewis**: The removal of "lewis" in various combinations leads to both changes and no changes in output, indicating a mixed influence. However, when "lewis" is removed along with other key words, it often leads to a change in output to 1, suggesting its presence or absence in combination with certain words can be influential. Its impact seems moderate because its removal alone does not consistently predict the output change. Importance: 60

2. **Black**: Similar to "lewis", the removal of "black" shows a mixed influence on the output. It appears in combinations that lead to both changes and no changes in output. However, its removal, especially when combined with "lewis", tends to result in a significant change in output. This suggests that "black" might have a slightly higher importance than "lewis" due to its consistent appearance in impactful combinations. Importance: 65

3. **PG-13**: The word "pg-13" shows a strong correlation with changes in output. Its removal often leads to a change in output to 0, indicating that it plays a crucial role in determining the output. The presence of "pg-13" seems to be a key factor in maintaining the original sentiment or classification of the sentence, suggesting a high level of importance. Importance: 85

Ranking the importance based on the analysis and the scale provided:

1. PG-13
2. Black
3. Lewis

Final Rank: PG-13, Black, Lewis
