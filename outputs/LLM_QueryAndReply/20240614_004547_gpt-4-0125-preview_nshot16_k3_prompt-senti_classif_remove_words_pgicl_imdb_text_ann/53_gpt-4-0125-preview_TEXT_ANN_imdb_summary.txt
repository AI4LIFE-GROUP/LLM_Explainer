Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of specific words being removed on the change in output. The key is to identify words whose removal consistently leads to a change in output, indicating their importance in the original sentence's sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model.

1. **Waste**: The word "waste" appears in several removals, and its absence sometimes correlates with a change in output and sometimes does not. However, its presence in contexts that lead to a negative output change (-1) when removed, such as in "in - this monumental waste time energy and would" and "in a monumental waste of energy would not recommend to see film", suggests a moderate level of importance. Its impact is not as clear-cut due to mixed results, but it's significant enough to consider initially. **Importance: 60**

2. **Recommend**: The word "recommend" is crucial. Its removal in contexts where the output changes to -1, such as "in this waste of and i would not to", indicates a strong negative sentiment when absent. Given its role in the sentence's overall recommendation, its removal leading to a negative change suggests a high importance. **Importance: 90**

3. **Not**: The word "not" is pivotal. Its removal in several instances leads to a change in output, such as "in - this was a monumental waste of and energy i not recommend anyone to ever see this film" and "in this waste of and i would not to", indicating a significant shift in sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. This suggests that "not" is critical for maintaining the original negative sentiment of the sentence. **Importance: 95**

4. **Energy**: The word "energy" appears to have a lower impact on the change in output. Its removal in sentences does not consistently lead to a significant change in output, suggesting it's of lesser importance compared to "waste", "recommend", and "not". **Importance: 40**

5. **Monumental**: While "monumental" is an adjective that amplifies the sentiment, its removal doesn't consistently lead to a negative change in output. It seems to have a moderate impact, but less so than "waste", "recommend", and "not". **Importance: 50**

6. **Ever**: The word "ever" appears in contexts of both changes and no changes in output, but its removal doesn't show a strong correlation with a consistent change in direction, suggesting it's of lesser importance. **Importance: 30**

7. **Film**: The word "film" is part of the subject matter but removing it doesn't consistently impact the sentiment in a way that changes the output significantly. Its importance is relatively low in terms of sentiment analysis. **Importance: 20**

Based on the analysis and the importance ratings, the top three most important words driving the output, considering both their presence and absence, are:

**not, recommend, waste**
