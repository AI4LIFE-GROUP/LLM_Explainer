Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. We'll focus on words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, indicating their importance in the original sentence's meaning or sentiment as interpreted by the model.

1. **"unbelievable"** - This word's removal is consistently associated with a change in output (-1) in multiple instances, suggesting its high importance in contributing to the model's output. Its presence or absence directly influences the sentiment or meaning, leading to a significant change. Importance: 90

2. **"stories"** - The removal of "stories" in some cases leads to no change, but in combination with other words, it contributes to a change. Its impact seems less direct than "unbelievable" but still notable. Importance: 60

3. **"as"** - The removal of "as" alone or in combination mostly leads to no change in output, suggesting its role is less critical in influencing the model's interpretation of the sentence. Importance: 20

4. **"the"** - The removal of "the" in various combinations leads to a change in output (-1) in several instances. This indicates its role in the structure and meaning of the sentence, making it somewhat important. Importance: 70

5. **"actors"** - Similar to "stories," its removal in combination affects the output, but it's hard to isolate its impact directly. It seems to play a role but less so than "unbelievable" or "the." Importance: 50

6. **"were"** - The removal of "were" in combinations doesn't directly correlate with a consistent change in output, suggesting its importance is relatively low in affecting the model's interpretation. Importance: 30

Ranking the words based on their importance in determining the output, from most important to least important, we get:

unbelievable, the, stories, actors, were, as
