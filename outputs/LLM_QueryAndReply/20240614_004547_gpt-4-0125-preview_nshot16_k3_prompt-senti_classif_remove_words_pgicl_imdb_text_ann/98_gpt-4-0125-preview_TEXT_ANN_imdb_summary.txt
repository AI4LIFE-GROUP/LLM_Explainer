Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences of specific words in the dataset and their impact on the change in output. We'll focus on the words that appear frequently in both scenarios where the change in output is 1 and 0. Key words to consider based on their repeated presence and the context of removals include "memorable," "characters," and "found."

1. **Memorable**: This word appears in several instances where its removal leads to both changes in output to 1 and to 0. Its presence or absence doesn't consistently sway the output in one direction, indicating a balanced influence on the model's decision-making process. However, given its direct relation to the sentiment of the original sentence, its impact is significant. Rating: 70

2. **Characters**: The word "characters" is crucial as it is central to the subject of the original sentence. Its removal sometimes leads to a change in output to 0 and other times to 1, showing it has a considerable impact but not always in the same direction. This suggests that while "characters" is an important element of the sentence, the model's output is influenced by how this subject is framed by the remaining words. Rating: 60

3. **Found**: The word "found" appears less frequently in the critical removals but is part of a phrase that significantly alters the output when removed. Its removal tends to lead to a change in output to 1, indicating a negative correlation with the model's original sentiment or decision. This suggests that "found" contributes to the model's understanding of the reviewer's personal experience, but its overall impact is less than "memorable" and "characters" due to its less frequent appearance in decisive changes. Rating: 50

Based on the analysis and the importance ratings, the final rank from most important to least important is:

**Memorable, Characters, Found**
