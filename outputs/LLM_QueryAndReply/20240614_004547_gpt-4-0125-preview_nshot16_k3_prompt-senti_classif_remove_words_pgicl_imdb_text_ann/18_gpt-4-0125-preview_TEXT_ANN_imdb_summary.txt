Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. We'll focus on words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, indicating a strong influence on the model's decision-making process.

1. **"right"**: Appears in multiple instances where its removal leads to a change in output. It's removed in both contexts where the output changes to 1 and remains in contexts where the output is 0, suggesting a high importance. **Importance: 90**

2. **"this"**: Its removal sometimes leads to a change and sometimes does not, indicating a moderate level of importance. However, its inconsistency in affecting the change lowers its importance relative to "right". **Importance: 60**

3. **"very"**: Similar to "this", its removal shows some level of influence on the output change, but less consistently than "right". **Importance: 50**

4. **"on"**: The word "on" appears in several key phrases ("right on case", "almost right in your face") and its removal, especially in combination with other words, affects the output. However, its standalone impact seems less direct than "right". **Importance: 70**

5. **"case"**: The removal of "case" in various combinations does not consistently affect the output change, suggesting its importance is lower than "right" but potentially on par or slightly less than "on". **Importance: 65**

6. **"movie"**: Appears in many instances but its removal does not consistently lead to a change in output, suggesting its importance is moderate but not as critical as "right" or "on". **Importance: 55**

7. **"delivers"**, **"everything"**, **"almost"**, **"in"**, **"your"**, **"face"**: These words appear in various combinations, but their individual impact seems diluted across the dataset, making it challenging to pinpoint a high level of importance relative to "right". **Importance: 40-50**

Based on the analysis, the words that consistently influence the change in output, indicating their importance in the model's decision-making process, are ranked as follows:

1. **"right"** has the highest importance due to its consistent presence in changes leading to both increases and decreases in output.
2. **"on"** follows, given its role in key phrases that, when altered, affect the output, though its impact is slightly less direct than "right".
3. **"case"** is next, showing a moderate level of importance through its presence in phrases affecting the output, but with a less consistent impact than "right" or "on".

Therefore, the top three most important words driving the output, in descending order of importance, are:

right, on, case
