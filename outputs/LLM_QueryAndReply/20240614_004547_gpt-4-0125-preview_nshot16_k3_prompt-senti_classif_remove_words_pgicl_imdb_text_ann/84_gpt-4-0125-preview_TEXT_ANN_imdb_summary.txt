Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word removal on the change in output. We'll focus on words that appear in both contexts where their removal leads to a change in output (either from 0 to -1 or vice versa) and where their removal does not lead to a change in output. This approach will help us identify words that consistently influence the model's output when removed.

1. **"movie"** - This word appears in several instances where its removal either leads to a change in output or does not. Notably, its removal is involved in both scenarios where the output changes and where it remains the same, suggesting its importance but also indicating it's not solely responsible for changes in output. Importance: 70

2. **"garbage"** - The word "garbage" appears in multiple instances and its removal sometimes leads to a change in output and sometimes does not. Given its presence in contexts with both outcomes, it seems to have a significant but not exclusive influence on the output. Importance: 60

3. **"real"** - Similar to "movie," the word "real" is present in various removals affecting the output in both directions. Its role in sentences that critique the movie suggests it's a key term for sentiment but, like "movie," it's not the only factor. Importance: 65

Ranking so far based on analysis: **movie, real, garbage**

4. **"understand"** - Appears frequently in removals but its absence doesn't consistently correlate with a change in output. It seems less pivotal in determining sentiment compared to words directly related to the movie's quality. Importance: 50

Updated rank: **movie, real, garbage, understand**

5. **"shelves"** - The word "shelves" appears in several removals but seems contextually less significant to the sentiment about the movie itself and more about its placement, which indirectly affects sentiment. Importance: 40

Updated rank: **movie, real, garbage, understand, shelves**

6. **"how"** and **"s"** (as in it's) - Both appear in various contexts but their removal doesn't show a consistent pattern of influencing the output directly related to sentiment about the movie's quality. Importance: 30 for both

Final rank before top three selection: **movie, real, garbage, understand, shelves, how, s**

Top three most important words driving the output, based on the analysis: **movie, real, garbage**
