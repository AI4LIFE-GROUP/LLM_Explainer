Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the influence of each word's presence or absence on the change in output. We'll focus on instances where the removal of specific words leads to a consistent change in output, indicating their importance.

1. **"good"** - The removal of "good" in some instances leads to a change in output from 0 to 1 and vice versa. This word appears to play a significant role in flipping the output, indicating its high importance. Considering its presence in multiple scenarios with varied outcomes, its importance is rated high.

2. **"sad"** - The word "sad" also seems to influence the output significantly. However, its direct impact is less consistently observed compared to "good". Its importance is noted but appears to be secondary to "good".

3. **"very"** - The removal of "very" directly changes the output in one instance. This suggests that while "very" has some influence, it is not as critical as "good" or "sad" for determining the output. Its importance is there but lower compared to "good" and "sad".

4. **"movie"** - The word "movie" has a mixed influence on the output. Its removal in some cases leads to a change, but this is not as consistent or impactful as "good". Thus, it's considered less important than "good", "sad", and "very".

5. **"it"** and **"but"** - Both "it" and "but" show influence in the output change in specific instances. However, their impact seems to be less direct and more context-dependent compared to the words analyzed above. They are considered even less important than "movie".

6. **Other words** like "a", "s", "'", and "but" have shown to influence the output in certain configurations but their impact is highly context-dependent and not as directly tied to the sentiment or key descriptors of the sentence. Therefore, they are ranked as the least important in driving the output.

Based on the analysis and considering both positive and negative correlations equally, the final rank from most important to least important is:

**good, sad, very, movie, it, but**
