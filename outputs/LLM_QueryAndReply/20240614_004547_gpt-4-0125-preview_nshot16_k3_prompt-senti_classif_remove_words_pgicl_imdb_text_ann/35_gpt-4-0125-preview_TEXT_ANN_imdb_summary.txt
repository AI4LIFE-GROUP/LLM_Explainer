Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. A change in output indicates the word's importance in the original sentence's meaning as interpreted by the model. We'll consider both instances where its removal led to a change (either -1 or 0) and where its presence or absence didn't affect the output.

1. **that**: Removal of "that" shows varied effects. In some cases, its removal (along with other words) leads to a change in output (-1), but in others, it does not affect the output (0). This inconsistency suggests "that" has a moderate impact depending on context. However, since its removal alone or in combination doesn't consistently drive the output to change, its importance is relatively lower compared to words that consistently cause a change. **Importance: 40**

2. **was**: The removal of "was" in various combinations consistently results in a change in output (-1) in several instances, but also shows no change when removed with certain words. This indicates a higher importance than "that" because its removal is often associated with a negative change in output. **Importance: 60**

3. **done**: The word "done" shows a similar pattern to "that" in terms of inconsistency in affecting the output. Its removal sometimes leads to no change and other times is part of combinations that do not alter the output. Thus, its importance is on par with "that". **Importance: 40**

4. **in**: The removal of "in" along with other words sometimes leads to no change and other times to a change. This inconsistency places it in a similar importance level as "done" and "that", but given the context of its usage and the combinations where its removal leads to a change, it might hold slightly more contextual weight. **Importance: 45**

5. **the**: "the" shows a pattern where its removal, especially in combination with other words, often does not significantly affect the output. This suggests it's less critical in driving the model's interpretation of the sentence. **Importance: 30**

6. **second**: The removal of "second" consistently results in a change in output (-1) in several combinations. This indicates a high level of importance, as its absence significantly impacts the model's output, suggesting it's a key element in the sentence's context. **Importance: 80**

7. **movie**: Similar to "second", the removal of "movie" often results in a change in output (-1). This suggests that "movie" is crucial for the sentence's meaning as interpreted by the model. **Importance: 80**

Ranking the words based on their determined importance, we get:

**second, movie, was, in, that = done, the**

Given the equal importance of "second" and "movie" and the slightly lower but significant importance of "was", followed by "in", and the least importance attributed to "that", "done", and "the" (with "that" and "done" being equally impactful), the final rank is:

second, movie, was, in, that, done, the
