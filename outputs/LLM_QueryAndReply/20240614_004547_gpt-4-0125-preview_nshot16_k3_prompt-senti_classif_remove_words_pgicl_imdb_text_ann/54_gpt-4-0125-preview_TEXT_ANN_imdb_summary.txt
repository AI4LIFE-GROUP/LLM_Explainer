Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze each word's presence or absence in the dataset and its impact on the change in output. We'll consider how the removal of specific words or combinations of words affects the model's output, focusing on changes that indicate a significant shift in meaning or sentiment as perceived by the model.

1. **not**: The removal of "not" in combinations where "easily" is also removed consistently results in no change in output (0). However, when "not" is removed along with "a", the change in output is -1. This suggests that "not" on its own does not have a strong impact unless it modifies specific words, indicating its importance is more contextual rather than standalone. Importance: 30

2. **easily**: Similar to "not", "easily" removal alongside "not" results in no change. Its removal alone or in different combinations does not directly correlate with a consistent negative or positive change, suggesting its role is more of a modifier that doesn't significantly alter the sentiment by itself. Importance: 20

3. **film**: The removal of "film" in combinations like "film forgotten" results in a change of -1. This indicates that "film" has a more substantial role in the sentence's sentiment or meaning, as its removal with key words leads to a negative change. Importance: 60

4. **forgotten**: The removal of "forgotten" consistently results in a change of -1, whether it's removed alone or with other words (except in the full sentence removal, which is a special case). This suggests that "forgotten" is crucial in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence. Importance: 90

5. **a**: The removal of "a" alone results in no change (0), and its impact seems negligible when considered with other words, except when removed with "not", which leads to a -1 change. This indicates "a" has the least impact on the sentiment or meaning alteration. Importance: 10

Based on the analysis, the words can be ranked in terms of their importance in driving the output as follows:

forgotten, film, not, easily, a
