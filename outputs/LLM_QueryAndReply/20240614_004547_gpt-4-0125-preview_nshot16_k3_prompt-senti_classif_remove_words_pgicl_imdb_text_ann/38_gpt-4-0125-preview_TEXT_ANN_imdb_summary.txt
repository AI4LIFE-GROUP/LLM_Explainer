Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. We'll focus on the words that appear in the removals that lead to a change in output (-1) and those that, when removed, do not lead to a change in output (0). The words to consider based on their presence or absence in impactful removals are "this", "movie", "is", "bad", "agree", and "with".

1. **"this"**: Removals involving "this" show varied impacts on the output. However, it's part of combinations that lead to both changes and no changes in output, indicating its influence is context-dependent rather than direct. Importance: 40

2. **"movie"**: Similar to "this", "movie" is part of combinations that both affect and do not affect the output. Its presence in negative output changes suggests a moderate level of importance. Compared to "this", its role seems slightly more direct in influencing the sentiment of the sentence. Importance: 50. Running rank: movie, this

3. **"is"**: The word "is" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output. Its removal, especially in conjunction with "bad", often results in a negative change, suggesting a strong correlation with the model's output. Importance: 60. Running rank: is, movie, this

4. **"bad"**: The presence or absence of "bad" consistently influences the output change. Its removal almost always results in a negative change in output, highlighting its critical role in the sentiment analysis performed by the model. Importance: 90. Running rank: bad, is, movie, this

5. **"agree"**: The removal of "agree" in various contexts shows a significant impact on the output, indicating its importance in the overall sentiment of the sentence. However, its effect is not as consistently tied to negative changes in output as "bad". Importance: 70. Running rank: bad, agree, is, movie, this

6. **"with"**: The word "with" appears in several removals but its impact seems less direct compared to words like "bad" or "agree". Its removal doesn't consistently lead to a change in output, suggesting its role is more about sentence structure than sentiment. Importance: 30. Running rank: bad, agree, is, movie, this, with

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, in descending order of importance, are:

bad, agree, is
