Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we need to analyze the occurrences and removals of specific words across different instances where the change in output is observed. We focus on words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, either from 0 to -1 or vice versa. 

1. **"however"** - This word appears to be removed in several instances, with both changes in output to -1 and instances where the output remains 0. Its removal alone does not consistently predict a change in output, suggesting its importance is moderate but not critical. Importance: 50

2. **"stupid"** - The word "stupid" is closely associated with the negative sentiment of the original sentence. Its removal in contexts that lead to a change in output suggests a high importance. However, since it does not appear in every instance of output change, its importance is significant but not absolute. Importance: 70

3. **"extremely"** - This modifier intensifies the sentiment conveyed by "stupid" and other descriptors. Its removal in several instances correlates with a change in output, indicating its role in amplifying the sentiment. However, like "stupid," it is not present in all instances leading to a change. Importance: 60

4. **"inconsistencies"** - The word "inconsistencies" is removed in multiple instances, with mixed effects on the output. It seems to contribute to the negative sentiment but is not a standalone factor for change. Importance: 40

5. **"horrid"** - This word directly contributes to the negative sentiment, especially regarding "the dancing." Its removal in instances leading to a change in output suggests a high importance, similar to "stupid." Importance: 70

6. **"crap"** - Similar to "horrid" and "stupid," the word "crap" significantly contributes to the negative sentiment. Its removal is often associated with a change in output. Importance: 70

Given the analysis, the relative importance of these words in driving the output change, considering both their presence and absence, is as follows:

1. **"stupid"** - Its removal is closely associated with changes in output, indicating its strong influence on the sentiment analysis.
2. **"horrid"**, **"crap"** - Both words are equally important in contributing to the negative sentiment of the sentence. Their removal often leads to a change in output, indicating their strong influence.
3. **"extremely"** - Acts as an amplifier for other negative words, its importance is slightly less because it modifies rather than contributes a standalone sentiment.
4. **"however"** - While its removal is frequent, it does not consistently predict a change in output, suggesting its role is more about the structure than sentiment.
5. **"inconsistencies"** - Its contribution to the negative sentiment is there but less direct compared to the other words analyzed.

Final rank: stupid, horrid, crap
