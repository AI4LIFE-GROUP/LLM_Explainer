Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that whenever any word or combination of words is removed from the original sentence, the change in output is 0. However, when the entire sentence "customer service was terrible" is removed, the change in output is -1. This suggests that the model is considering the entire sentence as a single entity to determine the output. 

However, if we were to rank the words based on their individual appearances in the removed words list, we can see that 'customer', 'service', and 'terrible' appear more frequently than 'was' and '.'. This could suggest that these words might have a higher influence on the model's output. 

But, since the change in output is only affected when the entire sentence is removed, it's difficult to determine the individual importance of each word. Therefore, the importance of each word is likely to be equal.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, in no particular order, are 'customer', 'service', and 'terrible'.

Customer, Service, Terrible
