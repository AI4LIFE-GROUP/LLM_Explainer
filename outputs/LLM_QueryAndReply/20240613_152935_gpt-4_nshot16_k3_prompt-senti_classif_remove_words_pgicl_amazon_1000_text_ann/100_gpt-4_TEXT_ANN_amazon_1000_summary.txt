Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 (no change) or -1 (negative change). 

1. The word 'double' is removed in all instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'double' is a key word in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

2. The word 'booking' is also removed in all instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'booking' is also a key word in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

3. The word 'possibility' is removed in most instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'possibility' is also a key word in determining the output, but it is not as important as 'double' and 'booking'. I would rate its importance as 90.

4. The word 'allows' is removed in some instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'allows' is somewhat important in determining the output, but it is not as important as 'double', 'booking', and 'possibility'. I would rate its importance as 80.

5. The word 'this' is removed in some instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'this' is somewhat important in determining the output, but it is not as important as 'double', 'booking', 'possibility', and 'allows'. I would rate its importance as 70.

6. The words 'the', 'of', 'for', 'same', 'date', 'and', 'time', 'after', 'first', and '.' are removed in various instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. However, these words are also removed in instances where the output remains 0. This suggests that these words are not as important in determining the output. I would rate their importance as 50.

Based on this analysis, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is: double, booking, possibility, allows, this, the, of, for, same, date, and, time, after, first, .

Double, Booking, Possibility
