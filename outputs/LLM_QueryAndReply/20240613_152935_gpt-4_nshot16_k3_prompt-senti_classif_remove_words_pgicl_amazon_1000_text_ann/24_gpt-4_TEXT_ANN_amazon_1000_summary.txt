Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes from 0 to -1 when the words 'buy', 'warning', and 'not' are removed. This suggests that these words are important in driving the output. 

1. 'Buy': Every time the word 'buy' is removed, the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests a strong negative correlation between the presence of 'buy' and the output. Importance: 100.

2. 'Warning': The word 'warning' also seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. Every time it is removed, the output changes from 0 to -1. Importance: 100.

3. 'Not': The word 'not' also seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. Every time it is removed, the output changes from 0 to -1. Importance: 100.

4. 'Do': The word 'do' does not seem to have a significant impact on the output. When it is removed, the output remains the same. Importance: 0.

5. '-': The symbol '-' does not seem to have a significant impact on the output. When it is removed, the output remains the same. Importance: 0.

6. '!': The symbol '!' does not seem to have a significant impact on the output. When it is removed, the output remains the same. Importance: 0.

7. '.': The symbol '.' does not seem to have a significant impact on the output. When it is removed, the output remains the same. Importance: 0.

Final rank: buy, warning, not, do, -, !, .
