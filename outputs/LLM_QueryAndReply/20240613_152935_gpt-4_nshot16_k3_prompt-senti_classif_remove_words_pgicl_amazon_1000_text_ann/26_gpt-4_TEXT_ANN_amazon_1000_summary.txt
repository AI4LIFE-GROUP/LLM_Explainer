Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words 'has', 'it', and 'features' seem to be the most important in driving the output. 

The word 'has' appears in 9 out of 10 instances where the output changes to 1, indicating a strong positive correlation. It also appears in 6 out of 6 instances where the output changes to 0, indicating a strong negative correlation. This suggests that 'has' is a key word in determining the output.

The word 'it' appears in 4 out of 10 instances where the output changes to 1, indicating a moderate positive correlation. It also appears in 3 out of 6 instances where the output changes to 0, indicating a moderate negative correlation. This suggests that 'it' is also important in determining the output.

The word 'features' appears in 3 out of 10 instances where the output changes to 1, indicating a moderate positive correlation. It also appears in 2 out of 6 instances where the output changes to 0, indicating a moderate negative correlation. This suggests that 'features' is somewhat important in determining the output.

The other words ('all', 'the', 'i', 'want') appear less frequently in instances where the output changes, suggesting they are less important in determining the output.

Final rank: has, it, features, all, the, i, want.
