Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows the change in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output of -1 indicates that the removed words had a significant impact on the model's output, while a change of 0 indicates that the removed words had no impact.

1. 'Better': This word appears in several instances where the change in output is -1, indicating that it has a significant impact on the model's output. However, it also appears in instances where the change in output is 0, suggesting that its impact is not consistent. Importance: 70

2. 'Keep': This word also appears in several instances where the change in output is -1, indicating that it has a significant impact on the model's output. However, like 'better', it also appears in instances where the change in output is 0, suggesting that its impact is not consistent. Importance: 70

3. 'Getting': This word appears in a few instances where the change in output is -1, indicating that it has some impact on the model's output. However, it also appears in instances where the change in output is 0, suggesting that its impact is not consistent. Importance: 60

Based on this analysis, the running rank of the words is 'better', 'keep', 'getting'. However, it's important to note that the importance of these words is not absolute and can vary depending on the context and the specific model used.

Final Answer: better, keep, getting
