Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words 'i', 'recommend', and 'would' seem to have the most influence on the model's output. When 'i' and 'recommend' are removed, the output changes by 1. This suggests that these words have a strong positive correlation with the output. On the other hand, when 'would' is removed, the output changes by 0, indicating a negative correlation. 

However, when 'i recommend' is removed, the output changes by 1, suggesting that the combination of these words also has a significant impact on the output. Similarly, when 'would recommend' is removed, the output changes by 0, indicating that this combination also has a significant influence. 

The word 'it' and the punctuation mark '.' seem to have less influence on the output. When 'it' is removed, the output does not change, suggesting that it has a neutral correlation. The punctuation mark '.' also seems to have a neutral correlation, as its removal does not affect the output.

Based on this analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is as follows:

1. 'i'
2. 'recommend'
3. 'would'
4. 'it'
5. '.'

i, recommend, would
