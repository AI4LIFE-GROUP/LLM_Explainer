Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when certain words are removed from the sentence. This suggests that these words are important in driving the output. 

1. "Promised": The removal of this word often results in a change in output. This suggests that it has a high importance in determining the output. Importance: 90

2. "Charger": The removal of this word also often results in a change in output. However, it seems to be slightly less influential than "promised". Importance: 80

3. "Arrived": The removal of this word sometimes results in a change in output. However, it seems to be less influential than "promised" and "charger". Importance: 70

4. "Within": The removal of this word sometimes results in a change in output. However, it seems to be less influential than "promised", "charger", and "arrived". Importance: 60

5. "The": The removal of this word sometimes results in a change in output. However, it seems to be less influential than the other words. Importance: 50

6. "Timeframe": The removal of this word rarely results in a change in output. This suggests that it has a low importance in determining the output. Importance: 40

7. "But": The removal of this word rarely results in a change in output. This suggests that it has a low importance in determining the output. Importance: 30

8. "It": The removal of this word rarely results in a change in output. This suggests that it has a low importance in determining the output. Importance: 20

9. "Did": The removal of this word rarely results in a change in output. This suggests that it has a low importance in determining the output. Importance: 10

10. "Not": The removal of this word rarely results in a change in output. This suggests that it has a low importance in determining the output. Importance: 0

Final rank: Promised, Charger, Arrived, Within, The, Timeframe, But, It, Did, Not
