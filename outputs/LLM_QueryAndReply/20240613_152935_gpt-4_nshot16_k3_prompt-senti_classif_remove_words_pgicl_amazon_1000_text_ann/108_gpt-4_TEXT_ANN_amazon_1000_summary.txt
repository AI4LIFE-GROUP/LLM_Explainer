Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the importance of words in driving the output of a model. The output changes from 1 to 0 when certain words are removed from the original sentence. 

1. The word 'Motorola' seems to be of high importance. It is present in all the sentences where the output is 1 and removed in all sentences where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation. Importance: 90

2. The word 'because' also seems to be important. It is present in all sentences where the output is 1 and removed in all sentences where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation. However, it is less specific than 'Motorola', so it is ranked second. Importance: 85

3. The word 'over' is present in all sentences where the output is 1 and removed in all sentences where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation. However, it is less specific than 'Motorola' and 'because', so it is ranked third. Importance: 80

4. The word 'allot' is present in all sentences where the output is 1 and removed in all sentences where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation. However, it is less specific than 'Motorola', 'because', and 'over', so it is ranked fourth. Importance: 75

5. The word 'clearer' is present in all sentences where the output is 1 and removed in all sentences where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation. However, it is less specific than 'Motorola', 'because', 'over', and 'allot', so it is ranked fifth. Importance: 70

Final ranking: Motorola, because, over, allot, clearer.
