Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes every time the word "works" is removed, indicating that it has a strong influence on the model's output. The word "described" does not seem to have any effect on the output when removed, as the output remains the same. The word "as" also does not seem to have a significant effect on the output when removed, as the output remains the same. The period (.) also does not seem to have a significant effect on the output when removed, as the output remains the same.

Based on this analysis, the word "works" is the most important in driving the output, followed by "as", "described", and ".". The importance of "works" is rated at 100, while "as", "described", and "." are rated at 0, as they do not seem to influence the output.

Final rank: works, as, described, .
