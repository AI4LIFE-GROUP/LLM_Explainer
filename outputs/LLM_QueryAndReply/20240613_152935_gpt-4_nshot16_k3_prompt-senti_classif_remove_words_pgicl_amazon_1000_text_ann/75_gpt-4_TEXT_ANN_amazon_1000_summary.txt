Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'jawbone', 'is', and '!' are removed, indicating that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. 'Jawbone': The output changes every time 'jawbone' is removed, regardless of the other words in the sentence. This suggests that 'jawbone' has a strong influence on the output. Importance: 100

2. 'Is': The output changes every time 'is' is removed, regardless of the other words in the sentence. This suggests that 'is' also has a strong influence on the output. However, 'is' is a common word and may not carry as much unique information as 'jawbone'. Importance: 90

3. '!': The output changes every time '!' is removed, regardless of the other words in the sentence. This suggests that '!' has a strong influence on the output. However, '!' is a punctuation mark and may not carry as much unique information as 'jawbone' or 'is'. Importance: 80

The other words ('era', 'awesome', 'too') do not consistently change the output when removed, suggesting that they are less important in driving the output.

Final rank: Jawbone, Is, !
