Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence changes the model's output. The change in output is binary, either 1 or 0. A change in output of 1 indicates that the removal of the word(s) has a significant impact on the model's output, while a change in output of 0 indicates that the removal of the word(s) has no impact on the model's output.

1. "Everything": This word appears in 7 instances where the output changes (1) and does not appear in any instance where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "everything" is a key word that drives the output. Importance: 100

2. "About": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "about" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

3. "It": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "it" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

4. "Is": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "is" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

5. "Fine": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "fine" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

6. "And": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "and" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

7. "For": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "for" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

8. "The": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "the" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

9. "Price": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "price" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

10. "I": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "i" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

11. "E": This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes (1) and in 3 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "e" has a moderate impact on the output. Importance: 60

12. "Reasonable": This word appears in 4 instances where the output changes (1) and in 4 instances where the output does not change (0). This suggests that "reasonable" has a lesser impact on the output. Importance: 50

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "everything", "about", and "it".

Final Rank: Everything, About, It
