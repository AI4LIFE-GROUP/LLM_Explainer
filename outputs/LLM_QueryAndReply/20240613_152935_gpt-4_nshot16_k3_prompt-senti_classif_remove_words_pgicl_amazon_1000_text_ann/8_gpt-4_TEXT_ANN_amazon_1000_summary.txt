Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words 'has', 'working', and 'great' appear to have the most influence on the model's output. When these words are removed, the output changes from 0 to 1, indicating a significant impact. The word 'been' seems to have less influence as its removal does not change the output. The period (.) also seems to have less influence as its removal does not change the output.

The word 'has' appears in 8 instances where its removal changes the output, 'working' appears in 7 instances, and 'great' appears in 6 instances. This suggests that 'has' is the most influential, followed by 'working', and then 'great'. The word 'been' and the period (.) appear in fewer instances where their removal changes the output, suggesting they are less influential.

Therefore, the ranking from most important to least important is: 'has', 'working', 'great', 'been', '.'.

has, working, great, been, .
