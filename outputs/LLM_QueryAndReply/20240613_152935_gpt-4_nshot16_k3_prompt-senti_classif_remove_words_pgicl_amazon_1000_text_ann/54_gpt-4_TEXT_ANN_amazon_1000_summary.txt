Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is binary, either 0 or 1, indicating that the removal of certain words has a significant impact on the model's output. 

1. 'Far': The word 'far' appears in 7 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'far' has a high importance in determining the output. Importance: 90

2. 'It': The word 'it' appears in 5 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'it' has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance: 70

3. 'Has': The word 'has' appears in 5 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'has' has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance: 70

4. 'Worked': The word 'worked' appears in 4 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'worked' has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance: 60

5. 'Like': The word 'like' appears in 4 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'like' has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance: 60

6. 'Charm': The word 'charm' appears in 4 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'charm' has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance: 60

7. 'A': The word 'a' appears in 3 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'a' has a moderate importance in determining the output. Importance: 50

8. 'So': The word 'so' appears in 2 instances where it's removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that 'so' has a low importance in determining the output. Importance: 40

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'far', 'it', and 'has'.

Final Rank: Far, It, Has
