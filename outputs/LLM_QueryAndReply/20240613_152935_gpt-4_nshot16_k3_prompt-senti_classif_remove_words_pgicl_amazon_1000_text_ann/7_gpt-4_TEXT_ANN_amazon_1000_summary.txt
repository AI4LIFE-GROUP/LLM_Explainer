Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'big', 'what', and 'of' are removed, indicating that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. 'Big': The removal of 'big' consistently results in a change in output. This suggests that 'big' has a high importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

2. 'What': The removal of 'what' also consistently results in a change in output. This suggests that 'what' has a high importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

3. 'Of': The removal of 'of' results in a change in output in some cases, but not all. This suggests that 'of' has a moderate importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 50.

Comparing these three words, 'big' and 'what' seem to be equally important, while 'of' is less important. Therefore, the final rank is 'big', 'what', 'of'.

big, what, of
