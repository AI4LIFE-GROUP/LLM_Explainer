Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes by -1 when the words 'not' and 'reccommend' are removed, either together or separately. This suggests that these two words are the most important in driving the output. The word 'would' does not seem to have any effect on the output, as its removal does not change the output. The punctuation mark '.' also does not seem to have any effect on the output.

Based on this analysis, I would rank the words as follows:

1. 'not' - This word has a strong negative correlation with the output. When it is removed, the output decreases by 1. This suggests that it is very important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

2. 'reccommend' - This word also has a strong negative correlation with the output. When it is removed, the output decreases by 1. This suggests that it is also very important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 100.

3. 'would' - This word does not seem to have any effect on the output, as its removal does not change the output. This suggests that it is not very important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 0.

4. '.' - This punctuation mark also does not seem to have any effect on the output, as its removal does not change the output. This suggests that it is not very important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 0.

Final rank: not, reccommend, would, .
