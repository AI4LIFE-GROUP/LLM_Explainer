Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
Based on the dataset, it appears that the removal of any word or combination of words from the original sentence does not result in any change in the model's output. This suggests that all words in the sentence - 'good', 'case', 'excellent', and 'value' - have equal importance in driving the output. 

However, it's also possible that the model's output is not influenced by any of these words, given that their removal does not affect the output. In this case, the importance of all words would be rated as 0 on a scale of 0-100.

Given these observations, it's not possible to rank the words from most important to least important as they all appear to have equal influence on the model's output.

Final rank: good, case, excellent, value.
