Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'out', 'easily', and 'falls' are removed, indicating that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. 'Out': The removal of 'out' results in a change in output in two instances, suggesting that it has a significant influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 80.

2. 'Easily': The removal of 'easily' also results in a change in output in two instances, indicating that it too has a significant influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 80.

3. 'Falls': The removal of 'falls' results in a change in output in one instance, suggesting that it has a moderate influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 60.

Comparing these words, 'out' and 'easily' seem to have the same level of importance, while 'falls' is slightly less important. Therefore, the final rank is: 'out', 'easily', 'falls'. 

Out, Easily, Falls
