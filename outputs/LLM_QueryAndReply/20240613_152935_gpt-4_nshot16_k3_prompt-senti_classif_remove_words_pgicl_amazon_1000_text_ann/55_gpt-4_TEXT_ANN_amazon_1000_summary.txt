Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that when certain words are removed, the output changes. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. "Voice": When "voice" is removed, the output does not change. This suggests that "voice" has a low importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 10.

2. "Quality": When "quality" is removed, the output changes in some cases and remains the same in others. This suggests that "quality" has a moderate importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 50.

3. "Signal": When "signal" is removed, the output changes in some cases and remains the same in others. This suggests that "signal" has a moderate importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 50.

4. "Strength": When "strength" is removed, the output changes in some cases and remains the same in others. This suggests that "strength" has a moderate importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 50.

5. "Dropped": When "dropped" is removed, the output changes in some cases and remains the same in others. This suggests that "dropped" has a moderate importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 50.

6. "Calls": When "calls" is removed, the output changes in some cases and remains the same in others. This suggests that "calls" has a moderate importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 50.

Based on this analysis, the running rank of the words from most important to least important is: Quality, Signal, Strength, Dropped, Calls, Voice.

Quality, Signal, Strength, Dropped, Calls, Voice.
