Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the influence of word removals on the model's output. The output changes from 1 to 0 when certain words are removed. The words that are consistently present when the output is 1 and absent when the output is 0 are likely to be the most important words driving the output.

1. "bitpim": This word is present in 5 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation with the output. Importance: 90

2. "used": This word is present in 4 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as "bitpim". Importance: 80

3. "free": This word is present in 3 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as "bitpim" and "used". Importance: 70

4. "program": This word is present in 3 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as "bitpim", "used", and "free". Importance: 60

5. "can": This word is present in 3 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as the other words. Importance: 50

6. "find": This word is present in 3 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as the other words. Importance: 40

7. "internet": This word is present in 2 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as the other words. Importance: 30

8. "transfer": This word is present in 2 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as the other words. Importance: 20

9. "data": This word is present in 2 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as the other words. Importance: 10

10. "phone": This word is present in 2 instances where the output is 1 and absent in all instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output, but not as strong as the other words. Importance: 5

Final rank: bitpim, used, free, program, can, find, internet, transfer, data, phone.
