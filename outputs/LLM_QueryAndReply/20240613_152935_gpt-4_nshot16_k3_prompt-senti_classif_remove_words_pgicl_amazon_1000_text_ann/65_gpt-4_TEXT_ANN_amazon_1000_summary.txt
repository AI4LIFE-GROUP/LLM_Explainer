Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'thin', 'love', and 'how'. 

1. 'Thin': This word seems to have a significant impact on the output. Whenever it is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that 'thin' is a key word in determining the output. Importance: 100

2. 'Love': The word 'love' also seems to have a significant impact on the output. In most cases, when 'love' is removed, the output changes. However, there are instances where removing 'love' does not change the output, suggesting that it might not be as crucial as 'thin'. Importance: 80

3. 'How': The word 'how' seems to have a moderate impact on the output. In some cases, removing 'how' changes the output, but in others, it does not. This suggests that 'how' is somewhat important in determining the output, but not as much as 'thin' or 'love'. Importance: 60

The other words ('you', 'll', 'it', 'is', and '.') do not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In some cases, removing these words changes the output, but in others, it does not. This suggests that these words are less important in determining the output.

Final Rank: thin, love, how
