Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes from 1 to 0 when any word is removed from the sentence, indicating that all words contribute to the output. However, the words 'timely', 'shipment', and 'quality' appear to have a greater influence on the output as they are more frequently removed in the dataset. 

1. 'Timely': This word is removed 7 times in the dataset, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'timely' has a significant influence on the output. Importance: 90

2. 'Shipment': This word is removed 6 times in the dataset, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'shipment' also has a significant influence on the output, but slightly less than 'timely'. Importance: 85

3. 'Quality': This word is removed 5 times in the dataset, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'quality' has a significant influence on the output, but less than 'timely' and 'shipment'. Importance: 80

4. 'Product': This word is removed 4 times in the dataset, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'product' has some influence on the output, but less than 'timely', 'shipment', and 'quality'. Importance: 70

5. 'And': This word is removed 3 times in the dataset, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that 'and' has some influence on the output, but less than the other words. Importance: 60

6. '.': This punctuation mark is removed 3 times in the dataset, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that '.' has some influence on the output, but less than the other words. Importance: 50

Final rank: Timely, Shipment, Quality, Product, And, .
