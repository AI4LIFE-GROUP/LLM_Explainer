Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 (no change) or -1 (negative change). 

1. "We have gotten a lot of compliments on it" - This is the entire sentence. Its removal results in a -1 change, indicating that the entire sentence is important for the model's output. However, it doesn't provide specific insight into individual words' importance.

2. "It" - The removal of this word doesn't change the output, indicating that it's not very important.

3. "We have gotten a lot on" - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

4. "We have gotten a lot of compliments on ." - The removal of this phrase results in a -1 change, indicating that these words are important. The difference between this and the original sentence is the word "it", suggesting that "it" is not very important.

5. "We have a lot of compliments it ." - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

6. "We have gotten lot of on" - The removal of this phrase results in a -1 change, indicating that these words are important. The difference between this and the original sentence is "a, compliments, it", suggesting that "a" and "compliments" are important.

7. "We gotten a lot of compliments on it ." - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

8. "A it" - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

9. "We it" - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

10. "Gotten ." - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

11. "We of on it" - The removal of this phrase doesn't change the output, suggesting that these words are not very important.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "we have gotten lot of on", "we have gotten a lot of compliments on .", and "we have gotten lot of compliments on it". These phrases all result in a -1 change when removed, indicating their importance. However, the individual words' importance is difficult to determine due to the phrases' complexity.

Final Rank: we, have, gotten, lot, of, on, a, compliments, it.
