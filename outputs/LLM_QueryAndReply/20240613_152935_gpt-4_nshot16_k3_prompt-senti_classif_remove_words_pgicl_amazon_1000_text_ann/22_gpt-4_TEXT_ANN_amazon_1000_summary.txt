Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence changes the model's output. The change in output is binary, either 1 or 0, which suggests that the model's output is a binary classification. 

1. The word 'this': The removal of the word 'this' changes the output from the original sentence. This suggests that 'this' has a significant influence on the model's output. Importance: 80

2. The words 'good', 'and', 'fast': The removal of these words does not change the output, suggesting that they have less influence on the model's output. Importance: 'good' - 40, 'and' - 40, 'fast' - 40

3. The words 'is', 'a', 'good', 'and', 'it', 'got', 'here', 'really': The removal of these words changes the output, suggesting that they have a significant influence on the model's output. However, since these words are common and appear in other combinations that do not change the output, their individual importance is lower. Importance: 'is' - 60, 'a' - 60, 'it' - 60, 'got' - 60, 'here' - 60, 'really' - 60

4. The words 'a', 'got', 'really': The removal of these words does not change the output, suggesting that they have less influence on the model's output. Importance: 'a' - 40, 'got' - 40, 'really' - 40

5. The words 'this', 'a', 'good', 'and', 'it', 'got', 'really', 'fast': The removal of these words changes the output, suggesting that they have a significant influence on the model's output. However, since these words are common and appear in other combinations that do not change the output, their individual importance is lower. Importance: 'this' - 80, 'a' - 60, 'good' - 40, 'and' - 40, 'it' - 60, 'got' - 60, 'really' - 60, 'fast' - 40

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'this', 'is', and 'a'. 

Final Rank: this, is, a
