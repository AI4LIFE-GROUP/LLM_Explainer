Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'avoiding', 'recommend', and 'difficult'. 

1. 'Avoiding': This word appears in all the sentences where the output changes to -1 when removed. This suggests that it has a strong negative correlation with the output. Its importance rating would be around 90.

2. 'Recommend': This word also appears in most of the sentences where the output changes to -1 when removed. However, there are a few instances where its removal does not change the output, suggesting a slightly weaker correlation than 'avoiding'. Its importance rating would be around 80.

3. 'Difficult': This word appears in many sentences where the output changes to -1 when removed, but also in many where the output remains 0. This suggests a weaker correlation than 'avoiding' and 'recommend', but still significant. Its importance rating would be around 70.

The other words do not seem to have a consistent impact on the output, as their removal sometimes changes the output and sometimes does not. Therefore, they would have lower importance ratings.

Final rank: avoiding, recommend, difficult.
