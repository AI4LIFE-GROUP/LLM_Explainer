Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence results in a change in output. The change in output is either 0 or -1, indicating that the removal of certain words does not affect the output, while the removal of others decreases the output by 1.

1. "work either .": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

2. "that one didn ' work": The removal of these words decreases the output by 1, indicating that they are important in determining the output. Importance: 100

3. "that didn work": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

4. "work .": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

5. "either": The removal of this word does not change the output, indicating that it is not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

6. "' t work either .": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

7. "one didn t work either .": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

8. "that either": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

9. "that ' t .": The removal of these words does not change the output, indicating that they are not crucial in determining the output. Importance: 0

From the analysis, it is clear that the phrase "that one didn ' work" is the most important in driving the output. The other words or phrases do not seem to have any significant impact on the output. Therefore, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is:

that one didn ' work, work either ., that didn work, work ., either, ' t work either ., one didn t work either ., that either, that ' t .
