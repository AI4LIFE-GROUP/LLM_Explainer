Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence "Poor sound quality" results in a change in output. The change in output is either 0 or -1. 

1. The word "poor" - Every time the word "poor" is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that the word "poor" has a significant influence on the output. Therefore, I would rate its importance as 100.

2. The word "sound" - The removal of the word "sound" does not result in any change in the output. This suggests that the word "sound" has no influence on the output. Therefore, I would rate its importance as 0.

3. The word "quality" - The removal of the word "quality" does not result in any change in the output. This suggests that the word "quality" has no influence on the output. Therefore, I would rate its importance as 0.

Based on the above analysis, the word "poor" is the most important word driving the output, followed by "sound" and "quality" which have no influence on the output.

Final rank: poor, sound, quality.
