Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that whenever the word "money" is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that "money" has a significant influence on the model's output. On the other hand, when the words "waste" and "of" are removed, the output remains the same, indicating that these words have less influence on the model's output. 

However, it's important to note that the word "waste" appears in every instance where "money" is removed, so it's possible that "waste" also has some influence on the output, but it's not as clear-cut as with "money". The word "of" seems to have the least influence, as its removal never results in a change in output.

Based on this analysis, I would rank the words as follows:

1. Money: 100 - The removal of "money" always results in a change in output, indicating it has the most influence.
2. Waste: 50 - The word "waste" is present in every instance where "money" is removed, suggesting it may also have some influence on the output.
3. Of: 0 - The removal of "of" never results in a change in output, indicating it has the least influence.

Final Rank: Money, Waste, Of.
