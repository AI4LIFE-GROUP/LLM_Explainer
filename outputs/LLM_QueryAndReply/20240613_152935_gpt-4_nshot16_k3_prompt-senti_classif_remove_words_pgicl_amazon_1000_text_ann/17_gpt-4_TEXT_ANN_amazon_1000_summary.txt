Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes by -1 when any of the words 'superb', 'phone', 'on', 'network', and '.' are removed. This suggests that these words are important in driving the output. The words 'a' and 'great' do not seem to affect the output when removed, as the change in output remains 0. 

However, when we look at the combinations of words removed, we see that removing 'superb', 'phone', 'a', 'great', 'network', and '.' all at once results in no change in output. This suggests that the combination of these words does not influence the output as much as the individual words do. 

Based on this analysis, the word 'superb' seems to be the most important, as its removal always results in a change in output. The word 'phone' is the second most important, as its removal also always results in a change in output. The word 'on' is the third most important, as its removal usually results in a change in output. The words 'network' and '.' are less important, as their removal sometimes results in a change in output. The words 'a' and 'great' are the least important, as their removal never results in a change in output.

Final rank: superb, phone, on, network, ., a, great.
