Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'plantronics', 'buy', and '.' are removed, indicating that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. The word 'excelent' does not seem to affect the output when removed, suggesting it has less importance. The word 'bluetooth' also does not seem to affect the output when removed, suggesting it has less importance as well.

However, it's important to note that the word 'plantronics' appears more frequently in the 'removed words' list when the output changes, suggesting it might have a higher importance than 'buy' and '.'. 

Based on this analysis, I would rank the words as follows:

1. Plantronics - This word appears most frequently in the 'removed words' list when the output changes, suggesting it has the highest importance.
2. Buy - This word also appears frequently in the 'removed words' list when the output changes, suggesting it has high importance, but less than 'plantronics'.
3. . - This word appears less frequently in the 'removed words' list when the output changes, suggesting it has less importance than 'plantronics' and 'buy'.
4. Bluetooth - This word does not seem to affect the output when removed, suggesting it has less importance.
5. Excelent - This word does not seem to affect the output when removed, suggesting it has the least importance.

Plantronics, Buy, ., Bluetooth, Excelent
