Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of the word "works" consistently results in a change in output, indicating that it has a significant influence on the model's output. The word "for" also seems to have an impact when removed in conjunction with "works", but not when removed with "me". The word "me" and the punctuation "." do not seem to have any impact on the output when removed, as the output remains the same.

Based on this analysis, the importance of the words in determining the output can be rated as follows:

- "works": 100 (always results in a change in output when removed)
- "for": 50 (results in a change in output when removed with "works", but not with "me")
- "me": 0 (does not result in a change in output when removed)
- ".": 0 (does not result in a change in output when removed)

Therefore, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is: works, for, me, .

works, for, me, .
