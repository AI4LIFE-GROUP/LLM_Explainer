Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output seems to change from 0 to -1 when certain words are removed from the sentence. This suggests that these words are important in driving the output. 

1. The word 'colleague' is removed in 7 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'colleague' is a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 90.

2. The word '&' is removed in 8 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that '&' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 95, slightly higher than 'colleague' due to its more frequent removal in instances of output change.

3. The word 'i' is removed in 6 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'i' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 85, slightly lower than 'colleague' due to its less frequent removal in instances of output change.

4. The word 'reception' is removed in 4 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'reception' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 80, lower than 'i' due to its less frequent removal in instances of output change.

5. The word 'great' is removed in 3 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'great' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 75, lower than 'reception' due to its less frequent removal in instances of output change.

6. The word 'expensive' is removed in 3 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'expensive' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 70, lower than 'great' due to its less frequent removal in instances of output change.

7. The word 'performance' is removed in 2 instances where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'performance' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 65, lower than 'expensive' due to its less frequent removal in instances of output change.

8. The word 'my' is removed in 1 instance where the output changes from 0 to -1. This suggests that 'my' is also a key word in driving the output. I would rate its importance as 60, lower than 'performance' due to its less frequent removal in instances of output change.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are '&', 'colleague', and 'i'.

&, colleague, i
