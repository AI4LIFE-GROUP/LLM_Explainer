Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the importance of words in determining the output of a model. The output changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The change in output is either 0 or 1. 

1. The word 'battery' is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 4, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'battery' has a significant influence on the output. Importance: 70

2. The word 'replacement' is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'replacement' also has a significant influence on the output, but slightly less than 'battery'. Importance: 65

3. The word 'working' is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'working' has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 60

4. The word 'well' is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'well' has a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'working'. Importance: 60

5. The word 'original' is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'original' also has a significant influence on the output, similar to 'replacement'. Importance: 65

6. The word 'phone' is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'phone' also has a significant influence on the output, similar to 'original' and 'replacement'. Importance: 65

7. The word '2' is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word '2' also has a significant influence on the output, similar to 'phone', 'original', and 'replacement'. Importance: 65

8. The word 'years' is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'years' also has a significant influence on the output, similar to '2', 'phone', 'original', and 'replacement'. Importance: 65

9. The word 'ago' is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these instances, the output changes to 1 and in the other 3, the output changes to 0. This suggests that the word 'ago' also has a significant influence on the output, similar to 'years', '2', 'phone', 'original', and 'replacement'. Importance: 65

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'battery', 'replacement/original/phone/2/years/ago' (tied for second place), and 'working/well' (tied for third place).

Answer: battery, replacement, working
