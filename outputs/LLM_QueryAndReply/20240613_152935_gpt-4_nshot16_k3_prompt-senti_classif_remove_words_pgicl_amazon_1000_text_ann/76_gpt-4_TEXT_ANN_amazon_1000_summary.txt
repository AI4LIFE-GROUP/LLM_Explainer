Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words "shipped", "promptly", and "product" seem to be the most important in driving the output. 

1. "Shipped": This word appears in the removed words list for all instances where the change in output is 0. This suggests that the presence of the word "shipped" in the sentence is crucial for maintaining the original output. Therefore, its importance rating would be high, around 90.

2. "Promptly": This word also appears in the removed words list for all instances where the change in output is 0. Similar to "shipped", the presence of "promptly" seems to be important for the original output. Its importance rating would be around 85, slightly less than "shipped" as it appears less frequently in the dataset.

3. "Product": This word appears in the removed words list for most instances where the change in output is 0. It seems to be less important than "shipped" and "promptly", but still crucial for the original output. Its importance rating would be around 80.

The other words in the dataset do not seem to have as much influence on the output as these three words. They either appear less frequently in the removed words list or do not show a clear correlation with the change in output.

Final rank: shipped, promptly, product.
