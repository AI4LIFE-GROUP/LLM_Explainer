Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words "recommend", "would", and "highly" seem to be the most influential in driving the output. 

1. "Recommend": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and every time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests a strong correlation between the presence of "recommend" and the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be high, around 90.

2. "Would": This word appears in 10 out of 16 removals, and in 5 of those cases, the output changes. This suggests a moderate correlation between the presence of "would" and the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be moderate, around 70.

3. "Highly": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in 4 of those cases, the output changes. This suggests a moderate correlation between the presence of "highly" and the output. Therefore, its importance rating would be moderate, around 60.

The other words ("I", "this", "product") seem to have less influence on the output, as their removal does not consistently result in a change in output.

Final rank: recommend, would, highly.
