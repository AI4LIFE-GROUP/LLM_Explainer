Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output seems to change when certain words are removed from the sentence. The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'i', 'the', and 'complaint'. 

The word 'i' appears to have a significant impact on the output. Whenever it is removed, the output changes by -1. This suggests that 'i' is a key word in the sentence that the model is using to determine the output. 

The word 'the' also appears to have a significant impact on the output. It is present in many of the word removals that result in a change in output. However, it is not as consistently impactful as 'i', as there are instances where 'the' is removed and the output does not change.

The word 'complaint' is another word that seems to have a significant impact on the output. It is present in many of the word removals that result in a change in output. However, like 'the', it is not as consistently impactful as 'i'.

Based on this analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is: 'i', 'the', 'complaint'.

i, the, complaint
