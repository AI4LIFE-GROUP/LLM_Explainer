Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'life', 'highly', and 'unacceptable' are removed, suggesting that these words are important in driving the output. 

1. 'Life': When 'life' is removed, the output changes in two instances and remains the same in one instance. This suggests that 'life' has a significant influence on the output. Importance: 70

2. 'Highly': When 'highly' is removed, the output changes in all instances. This suggests that 'highly' has a very strong influence on the output. Importance: 90

3. 'Unacceptable': When 'unacceptable' is removed, the output changes in all instances. This suggests that 'unacceptable' also has a very strong influence on the output. Importance: 90

4. 'The': When 'the' is removed, the output changes in some instances and remains the same in others. This suggests that 'the' has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

5. 'Battery': When 'battery' is removed, the output remains the same in all instances. This suggests that 'battery' has a minimal influence on the output. Importance: 10

6. 'Is': When 'is' is removed, the output remains the same in all instances. This suggests that 'is' has a minimal influence on the output. Importance: 10

Based on the above analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is: 'highly', 'unacceptable', 'life', 'the', 'battery', 'is'.

Answer: highly, unacceptable, life
