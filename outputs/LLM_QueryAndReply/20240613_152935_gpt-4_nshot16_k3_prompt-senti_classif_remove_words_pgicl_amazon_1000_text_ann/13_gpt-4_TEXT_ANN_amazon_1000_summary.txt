Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes by -1 when the words 'make', 'same', and 'as' are removed from the sentence. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

On the other hand, the removal of the words 'do', 'me', and '.' does not seem to affect the output, suggesting that these words have less influence on the model's output. 

The word 'not' seems to have a mixed influence on the model's output. In some cases, its removal leads to a change in output, while in others, it does not. This suggests that the influence of 'not' on the model's output may depend on the context in which it is used.

Based on this analysis, I would rank the words as follows:

1. 'make': This word consistently leads to a change in output when removed, suggesting that it has a significant influence on the model's output.
2. 'same': Like 'make', this word also consistently leads to a change in output when removed, suggesting that it too has a significant influence on the model's output.
3. 'as': This word also consistently leads to a change in output when removed, suggesting that it has a significant influence on the model's output.
4. 'not': This word has a mixed influence on the model's output, suggesting that its influence may depend on the context in which it is used.
5. 'do', 'me', and '.': These words do not seem to affect the model's output, suggesting that they have less influence on the model's output.

make, same, as
