Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when certain words are removed from the sentence. If the output changes, it means that the removed word(s) had an influence on the output. If the output doesn't change, it means that the removed word(s) had no influence on the output. 

1. 'The': The output doesn't change when 'the' is removed. So, its importance is 0.
2. 'Design': The output changes when 'design' is removed. So, its importance is 100. Current ranking: Design, The.
3. 'Is': The output doesn't change when 'is' is removed. So, its importance is 0. Current ranking: Design, The, Is.
4. 'Very': This word is not individually tested in the dataset. So, we can't determine its importance.
5. 'Good': The output doesn't change when 'good' is removed. So, its importance is 0. Current ranking: Design, The, Is, Good.
6. '4': The output changes when '4' is removed. So, its importance is 100. Current ranking: Design, 4, The, Is, Good.
7. '.': The output doesn't change when '.' is removed. So, its importance is 0. Current ranking: Design, 4, The, Is, Good, .

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'Design', '4', and 'The'.

Answer: Design, 4, The
