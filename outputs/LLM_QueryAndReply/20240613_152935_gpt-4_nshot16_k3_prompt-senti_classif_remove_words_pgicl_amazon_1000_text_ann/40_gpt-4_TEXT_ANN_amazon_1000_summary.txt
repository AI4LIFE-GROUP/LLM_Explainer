Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when certain words are removed from the sentence. A change in output of -1 indicates that the word is important in driving the output, while a change of 0 indicates that the word is not as important. 

1. 'The': This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'the' has some importance, but it is not consistently influential. Importance score: 50.

2. 'Battery': This word appears in 5 removal sets, with 2 resulting in a change in output and 3 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'battery' has some importance, but it is less influential than 'the'. Importance score: 40.

3. 'Is': This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'is' has some importance, but it is not consistently influential. Importance score: 50.

4. 'Completely': This word appears in 6 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 2 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'completely' is quite important in driving the output. Importance score: 67.

5. 'Useless': This word appears in 7 removal sets, with 5 resulting in a change in output and 2 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'useless' is very important in driving the output. Importance score: 71.

6. 'To': This word appears in 6 removal sets, with 2 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'to' is not very important in driving the output. Importance score: 33.

7. 'Me': This word appears in 7 removal sets, with 3 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that 'me' has some importance, but it is not consistently influential. Importance score: 43.

8. '.': This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that '.' has some importance, but it is not consistently influential. Importance score: 50.

Final ranking from most important to least important: useless, completely, the, is, ., me, battery, to.
