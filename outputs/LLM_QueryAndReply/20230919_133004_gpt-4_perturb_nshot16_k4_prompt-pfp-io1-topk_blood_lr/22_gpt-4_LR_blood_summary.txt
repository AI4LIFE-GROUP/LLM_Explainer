REPLY:
The model's output seems to have a positive correlation with decreases in feature A and increases in features B, C, and D - when the values for A decreased or the values for B, C, or D increased, the resulting change in output was often 1.

Yet, the changes in feature A seem to have a stronger effect on the model's output, since the largest decreases in A have led to an output of 1 more consistently than increases in any other feature. Increases in B, C, and D have led to an output of 1 slightly less frequently, but these increases still often resulted in an output of 1. 

Among B, C, and D, feature B appears to have the second strongest effect. Despite smaller increases, output is more likely to be 1. On the other hand, changes in C and D had less consistent results. They both seem to have similar influence on the model outcomes.

Based on these observations, I would rank the features in the following order of importance:

A, B, C, D.
