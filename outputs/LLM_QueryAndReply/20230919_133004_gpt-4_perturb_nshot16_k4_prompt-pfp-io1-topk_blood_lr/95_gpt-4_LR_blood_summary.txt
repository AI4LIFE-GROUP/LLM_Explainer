REPLY:
Looking at the dataset, it can be observed that the change in 'A' and 'B' often lead us to predict the model's output. When 'A' increases or 'B' decreases, the output is mostly -1 and when 'A' decreases or 'B' increases, the output is generally 0. At the same time, 'C' and 'D' also show a trend. For 'C', negative changes often correspond to -1 output and positive changes correspond to a 0 output. 'D' works similarly with negative changes correlating to -1 and positive changes to 0, although there are a few exceptions in this case, making it slightly less predictable than the first three features. 

Using this analysis, it seems that 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' are all important features for determining the model's prediction, each feature contributing significantly to the final output. However, 'A' and 'B' are more consistent and reliable in predicting the model's output than 'C' and 'D'. 

A, B, C, D
