REPLY:
When determining feature importance, we want to look at how variation in a given feature corresponds to variation in the output. The first thing we notice in this dataset is that the change in output only takes two values, 0 and -1. 

From an initial look, the model seems to respond differently when the feature values increase or decrease. For example, increases in feature 'A' are associated with a decrease in output, while decreases in 'A' are associated with zero change in output. On the other hand, features 'B', 'C', and 'D' show a kind of inverted behavior where their decrease (or lesser increase for 'D') is related to a decrease in output, and their increase (or larger decrease for 'D') results in no change.

However, pinpointing the exact importance of each feature could be quite tricky without employing the use of statistical analysis tools. Some overlapping behaviors among features, as well as a relatively small dataset, could result in some distortions in the conclusions.

However, considering our observations, 'A' seems to be the most influential, as it shows clear and consistent behavior throughout the variations. 'B' and 'C' could be considered next in line due to their consistent behavior with output variations. The importance of 'D' seems to be less clear, with some mix-ups in its behavior towards the two possible changes, so it could be considered last.
