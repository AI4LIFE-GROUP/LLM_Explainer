REPLY:
Looking at the changes in input and changes in output, we can notice some patterns. 

There are two output options, -1 and 0, and these seem to correspond with different patterns in the inputs. 

When the input feature 'A' increases, the output tends to be -1 and when 'A' decreases, the output tends to be 0. This seems to suggest that 'A' has a major influence on the model's output. 

We can also notice that feature 'C' often has an inverse relationship with the output. When 'C' increases, the output tends to be 0, and when 'C' decreases, the output tends to be -1. 

The other two features, 'B' and 'D', also have some level of influence but it seems a bit less consistent than 'A' and 'C'. 

'B' generally increases when the output is 0 and changes in both directions when the output is -1. 'D' generally decreases when the output is -1 and has a unidirectional change when the output is 0. 

Based on this observation, I would say that from most to least important, the features are as follows:

A, C, B, D
