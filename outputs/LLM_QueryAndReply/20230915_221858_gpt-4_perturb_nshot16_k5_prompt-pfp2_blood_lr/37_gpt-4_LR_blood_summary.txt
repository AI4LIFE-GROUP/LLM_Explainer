For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to decrease (-1), and when 'A' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Given the consistent pattern observed, 'A' seems to be quite important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 80 out of 100.

Rank so far: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. Changes in 'B' do not seem to have a consistent effect on the output. Both increases and decreases in 'B' are associated with both decreases and no change in the output.
b. Given the lack of a clear pattern, 'B' seems to be less important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 40 out of 100.

Rank so far: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0), and when 'C' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a negative correlation between 'C' and the output, but in the opposite direction to 'A'.
b. Given the consistent pattern observed, 'C' seems to be quite important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 75 out of 100.

Rank so far: ACB

4. Feature 'D':
a. Changes in 'D' do not seem to have a consistent effect on the output. Both increases and decreases in 'D' are associated with both decreases and no change in the output.
b. Given the lack of a clear pattern, 'D' seems to be less important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 35 out of 100.

Final Rank: ACBD
