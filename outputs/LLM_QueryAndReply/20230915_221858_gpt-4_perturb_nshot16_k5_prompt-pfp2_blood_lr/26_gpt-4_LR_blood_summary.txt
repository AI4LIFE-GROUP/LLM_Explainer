For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to be 0. When 'A' decreases, the output tends to be 1. This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Given the consistent pattern observed, 'A' seems to be quite important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 85 out of 100.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. The changes in 'B' do not show a clear pattern with respect to the output. Both increases and decreases in 'B' are associated with both 0 and 1 outputs.
b. Given the lack of a clear pattern, 'B' seems to be less important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 30 out of 100.

Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to be 1. When 'C' decreases, the output tends to be 0. This suggests a positive correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Given the consistent pattern observed, 'C' seems to be quite important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 90 out of 100.

Rank: CAB

4. Feature 'D':
a. The changes in 'D' do not show a clear pattern with respect to the output. Both increases and decreases in 'D' are associated with both 0 and 1 outputs.
b. Given the lack of a clear pattern, 'D' seems to be less important in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 35 out of 100.

Final Rank: CABD
