Question: "Based on the above set, what are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

### Analysis of Feature 'A'

**Observations:**
- Positive changes in 'A' are generally associated with an output of 0.
- Negative changes in 'A' are generally associated with an output of 1.

**Importance Rating:** Given the clear pattern where positive and negative changes in 'A' correlate with specific outputs, 'A' seems highly influential in determining the model's output. However, without comparing it to other features yet, it's hard to give an exact number. Tentatively, let's rate its importance as 85 out of 100 due to its apparent strong correlation with the output.

### Analysis of Feature 'B'

**Observations:**
- There isn't a clear positive or negative trend in 'B' that correlates with a specific output, but larger changes (both positive and negative) in 'B' seem to be associated with an output of 1 more often than not.

**Importance Rating:** 'B' does seem to have an influence, but it's less clear-cut than 'A'. The correlation with the output is present but not as strong. Let's rate 'B' at 70 out of 100 for its importance.

**Running Rank after 'B':** AB

### Analysis of Feature 'C'

**Observations:**
- Positive changes in 'C' are generally associated with an output of 1.
- Negative changes in 'C', or very small changes, are more mixed but seem to lean towards an output of 0.

**Importance Rating:** 'C' shows a pattern similar to 'A' but with a bit less consistency due to some mixed results in negative or minimal changes. Let's rate 'C' at 80 out of 100 for its importance.

**Running Rank after 'C':** ACB

### Analysis of Feature 'D'

**Observations:**
- 'D' shows the least clear pattern in terms of its correlation with the output. Changes in 'D', both positive and negative, are associated with both outputs 0 and 1 without a clear trend.

**Importance Rating:** Given the lack of a clear pattern, 'D' seems to be the least important in determining the output. Let's rate 'D' at 50 out of 100 for its importance.

**Running Rank after 'D':** ACBD

### Final Rank of Features from Most Important to Least Important

A, C, B, D
