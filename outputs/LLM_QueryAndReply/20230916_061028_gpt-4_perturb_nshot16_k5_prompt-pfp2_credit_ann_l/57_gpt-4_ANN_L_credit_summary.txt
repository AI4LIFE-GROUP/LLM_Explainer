For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'J':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'J' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'J' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output decreases, and when 'A' decreases, the output remains the same. This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance of 'A': 70. It has a strong negative correlation with the output, but no positive correlation.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'B' decreases, the output decreases. This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance of 'B': 60. It has a negative correlation with the output, but not as strong as 'A'.

Rank: AB
