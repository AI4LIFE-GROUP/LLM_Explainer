Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output. When 'A' increases, the output tends to be 1 and when 'A' decreases, the output tends to be 0. Importance: 80

2. Feature 'B': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output. When 'B' increases, the output tends to be 0 and when 'B' decreases, the output tends to be 1. Importance: 70. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output. When 'C' increases, the output tends to be 1 and when 'C' decreases, the output tends to be 0. Importance: 80. Current rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output. When 'D' increases, the output tends to be 1 and when 'D' decreases, the output tends to be 0. Importance: 85. Current rank: DACB

5. Feature 'E': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'E' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DACEB

6. Feature 'F': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'F' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DACEFB

7. Feature 'G': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'G' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBG

8. Feature 'H': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'H' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBGH

9. Feature 'I': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'I' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBGHI

10. Feature 'J': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'J' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBGHIJ

11. Feature 'K': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'K' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBGHIJK

12. Feature 'L': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'L' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBGHIJKL

13. Feature 'M': This feature shows a weak correlation with the output. The changes in 'M' do not consistently lead to a specific output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DACEFBGHIJKLM

Based on the analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: D, A, C, E, B.
