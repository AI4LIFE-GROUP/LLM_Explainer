Question: "Based on the above set, what are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
A: 
1. Importance: 70
2. Position: 1st
A is rated 70 because it has a strong positive correlation with the output.

B:
1. Importance: 60
2. Position: 2nd
B is rated 60 because it has a moderate negative correlation with the output.

C:
1. Importance: 50
2. Position: 3rd
C is rated 50 because it has a weak positive correlation with the output.

D:
1. Importance: 40
2. Position: 4th
D is rated 40 because it has a weak positive correlation with the output.

A, B, C, D
