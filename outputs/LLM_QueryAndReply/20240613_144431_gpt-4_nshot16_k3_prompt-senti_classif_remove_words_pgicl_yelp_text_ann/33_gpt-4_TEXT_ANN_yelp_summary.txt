Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the importance of words in a sentence based on their removal and the corresponding change in output. The output changes between 0 and -1, with -1 indicating a significant change in the model's output when a word is removed. 

1. 'Pita': The word 'Pita' is removed in several instances, and in most of these cases, the output changes to -1. This suggests that 'Pita' is a significant word in the sentence. Importance: 80

2. 'Received': The word 'received' is removed in several instances, and in most of these cases, the output changes to -1. This suggests that 'received' is a significant word in the sentence. However, it seems to be slightly less impactful than 'Pita'. Importance: 70

3. 'Meat': The word 'meat' is removed in several instances, and in most of these cases, the output changes to -1. This suggests that 'meat' is a significant word in the sentence. However, it seems to be slightly less impactful than 'received'. Importance: 60

4. 'Huge': The word 'huge' is removed in several instances, and in most of these cases, the output changes to -1. This suggests that 'huge' is a significant word in the sentence. However, it seems to be slightly less impactful than 'meat'. Importance: 50

5. 'Thumbs': The word 'thumbs' is removed in several instances, and in most of these cases, the output changes to -1. This suggests that 'thumbs' is a significant word in the sentence. However, it seems to be slightly less impactful than 'huge'. Importance: 40

Based on the analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is as follows: Pita, Received, Meat, Huge, Thumbs.

Pita, Received, Meat, Huge, Thumbs
