Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that appear most frequently in the removed words list when the output changes are "needless", "will", and "again". These words appear in the removed words list 8, 7, and 6 times respectively when the output changes. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

On the other hand, words like "say", "back", "here", and "be" also appear frequently in the removed words list but they do not seem to have as much influence on the output change as the top three words. 

The word "needless" appears the most frequently when the output changes, suggesting it has the highest influence on the output. The word "will" appears the second most frequently, suggesting it has the second highest influence. The word "again" appears the third most frequently, suggesting it has the third highest influence.

Therefore, based on the frequency of appearance in the removed words list when the output changes, the top three most important words driving the output are "needless", "will", and "again".

Final Answer: needless, will, again
