Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "everyone", "attentive", and "service". 

When "everyone" is removed, the output changes in every instance. This suggests that "everyone" is a key word in determining the output. 

Similarly, when "attentive" is removed, the output also changes in every instance. This indicates that "attentive" is also a key word in determining the output. 

Finally, when "service" is removed, the output changes in every instance. This suggests that "service" is a key word in determining the output. 

However, it's important to note that the removal of other words also results in a change in output. This suggests that the model is sensitive to the removal of any word, not just "everyone", "attentive", and "service". 

Based on this analysis, I would rank the words as follows: 

1. Everyone
2. Attentive
3. Service

Everyone, Attentive, Service
