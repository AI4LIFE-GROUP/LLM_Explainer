Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the influence of word removals on the model's output. The output changes from 1 to 0 when certain words are removed, indicating that these words are important in driving the output. 

1. 'Loved': This word is removed in many instances where the output changes from 1 to 0. It seems to be a key word in driving the output. Importance: 90

2. 'It': This word is also removed in many instances where the output changes. However, it's not as consistent as 'loved'. Importance: 70

3. 'Friendly': This word is removed in several instances where the output changes. It seems to be somewhat important in driving the output. Importance: 60

4. 'Servers', 'Great', 'Food', 'Wonderful', 'Imaginative', 'Menu': These words are removed in various instances, but their removal doesn't consistently result in a change in output. They seem to have less influence on the output. Importance: 50

5. '.': This punctuation mark is removed in all instances where the output changes. However, it's also removed in all instances where the output doesn't change, indicating that it's not a key factor in driving the output. Importance: 30

6. ',': This punctuation mark is removed in many instances, but its removal doesn't consistently result in a change in output. It seems to have less influence on the output. Importance: 20

Based on the analysis, the ranking from most important to least important is: Loved, It, Friendly, Servers, Great, Food, Wonderful, Imaginative, Menu, ., ,
