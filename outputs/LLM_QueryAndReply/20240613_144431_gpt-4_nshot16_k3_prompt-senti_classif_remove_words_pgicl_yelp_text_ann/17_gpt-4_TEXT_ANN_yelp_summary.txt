Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves identifying the words that have the most influence on the model's output. This can be done by observing the change in output when a word is removed from the original sentence. If the output changes significantly when a word is removed, it can be inferred that the word has a high influence on the output. 

1. 'Perhaps': This word appears in 7 instances where the output changes. This suggests that it has a significant influence on the output. Importance: 70

2. 'Caught': This word appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that it has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 60

3. 'Reviews': This word appears in 6 instances where the output changes. This suggests that it has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 60

4. 'I': This word appears in 14 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

5. 'Them': This word appears in 6 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

6. 'On': This word appears in 7 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

7. 'An': This word appears in 6 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

8. 'Off': This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

9. 'Night': This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

10. 'Judging': This word appears in 5 instances where the output changes. However, it is a common word and its removal might not necessarily indicate a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Importance: 50

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'Perhaps', 'Caught', and 'Reviews'.

Final Rank: Perhaps, Caught, Reviews
