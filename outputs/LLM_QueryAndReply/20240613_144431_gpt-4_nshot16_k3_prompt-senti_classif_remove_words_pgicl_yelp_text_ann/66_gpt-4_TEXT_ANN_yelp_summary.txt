Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes when the words 'seafood', 'fresh', 'generous', 'portion', 'was', 'and', 'in', and 'the' are removed. However, the words 'seafood', 'fresh', 'generous', and 'portion' seem to have a more significant impact on the output than the others. 

1. 'Seafood': The output changes when 'seafood' is removed, indicating its importance. However, it's not as impactful as 'fresh', 'generous', and 'portion'. Importance: 70

2. 'Fresh': The output doesn't change when 'fresh' is removed alone, but it does when removed with other words. This suggests it has some importance, but not as much as 'generous' and 'portion'. Importance: 80

3. 'Generous': The output changes when 'generous' is removed, indicating its importance. It seems to be as impactful as 'portion'. Importance: 90

4. 'Portion': The output changes when 'portion' is removed, indicating its importance. It seems to be as impactful as 'generous'. Importance: 90

5. 'Was': The output doesn't change when 'was' is removed alone, but it does when removed with other words. This suggests it has some importance, but not as much as 'seafood', 'fresh', 'generous', and 'portion'. Importance: 60

6. 'And': The output doesn't change when 'and' is removed, suggesting it's not as important as the other words. Importance: 50

7. 'In': The output doesn't change when 'in' is removed, suggesting it's not as important as the other words. Importance: 50

8. 'The': The output changes when 'the' is removed, indicating its importance. However, it's not as impactful as 'seafood', 'fresh', 'generous', and 'portion'. Importance: 70

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'generous', 'portion', and 'fresh'.

Generous, Portion, Fresh
