Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes from 0 to 1 when certain words are removed, indicating that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. 'This': The word 'this' appears in 10 removal sets, and in all of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'this' has a strong positive correlation with the output. Importance: 90

2. 'Vegas': The word 'Vegas' appears in 4 removal sets, and in all of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'Vegas' has a strong positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than 'this', so its overall importance is slightly lower. Importance: 80

3. 'Buffet': The word 'Buffet' appears in 4 removal sets, and in all of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'Buffet' has a strong positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than 'this', so its overall importance is slightly lower. Importance: 80

4. 'Spot': The word 'Spot' appears in 3 removal sets, and in all of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'Spot' has a strong positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than 'this', 'Vegas', and 'Buffet', so its overall importance is lower. Importance: 70

5. 'Fav': The word 'Fav' appears in 3 removal sets, and in all of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'Fav' has a strong positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than 'this', 'Vegas', and 'Buffet', so its overall importance is lower. Importance: 70

6. 'New': The word 'New' appears in 2 removal sets, and in both of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'New' has a positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than the other words, so its overall importance is lower. Importance: 60

7. 'My': The word 'My' appears in 2 removal sets, and in both of these cases, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'My' has a positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than the other words, so its overall importance is lower. Importance: 60

8. 'Is': The word 'Is' appears in 1 removal set, and in this case, the output changes from 0 to 1. This suggests that 'Is' has a positive correlation with the output. However, it appears less frequently than the other words, so its overall importance is lower. Importance: 50

Based on the above analysis, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is:

This, Vegas, Buffet, Spot, Fav, New, My, Is
