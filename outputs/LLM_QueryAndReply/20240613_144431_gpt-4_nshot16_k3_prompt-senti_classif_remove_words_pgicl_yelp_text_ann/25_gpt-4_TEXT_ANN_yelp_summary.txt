Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 1 or 0, with 1 indicating a significant change and 0 indicating no change. 

1. "The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff." - This is the original sentence. When this entire sentence is removed, the output changes significantly. This suggests that the sentence as a whole is important for the model's output. However, it doesn't provide specific information about the importance of individual words.

2. "juries" - The removal of this word doesn't change the output, suggesting that it's not very important.

3. "staff" - This word appears in several phrases that, when removed, result in a change in output. This suggests that "staff" is an important word.

4. "crowds" - This word also appears in several phrases that, when removed, result in a change in output. This suggests that "crowds" is an important word.

5. "lawyers" - The removal of this word doesn't change the output in one instance, but it's also part of a phrase that, when removed, does change the output. This suggests that "lawyers" might be somewhat important, but not as important as "staff" or "crowds".

6. "court" - This word is part of several phrases that, when removed, result in a change in output. This suggests that "court" is an important word.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output appear to be "staff", "crowds", and "court". These words are part of the most phrases that, when removed, result in a change in output.

Final Answer: staff, crowds, court
