Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes from 1 to 0 when the words 'were', 'the', and 'dishes' are removed. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. 'Were': This word appears in 8 of the 16 removals, and in each case, its removal results in a change in output. This suggests that 'were' has a strong influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 90.

2. 'The': This word appears in 14 of the 16 removals, and in 7 of these cases, its removal results in a change in output. This suggests that 'the' has a moderate influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 70.

3. 'Dishes': This word appears in 10 of the 16 removals, and in 5 of these cases, its removal results in a change in output. This suggests that 'dishes' has a moderate influence on the model's output. I would rate its importance as 60.

Based on this analysis, the running rank of the words is 'were', 'the', 'dishes'. 

Final Answer: were, the, dishes.
