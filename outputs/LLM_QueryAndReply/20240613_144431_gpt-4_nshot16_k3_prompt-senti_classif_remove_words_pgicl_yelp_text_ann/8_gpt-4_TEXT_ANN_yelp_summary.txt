Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words "will", "ever", and "never" seem to be the most important in driving the output. 

1. "Will": This word appears in 6 different removals, and each time it is removed, the output changes. This suggests that "will" has a strong influence on the output. Importance: 90

2. "Ever": This word appears in 6 different removals. In 4 out of 6 cases, the output changes when "ever" is removed. This suggests that "ever" has a significant influence on the output, but not as strong as "will". Importance: 70

3. "Never": This word appears in 4 different removals. In 3 out of 4 cases, the output changes when "never" is removed. This suggests that "never" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 60

4. "Go": This word appears in 5 different removals. However, the output only changes in 1 out of 5 cases when "go" is removed. This suggests that "go" has a relatively low influence on the output. Importance: 30

5. ",": This punctuation mark appears in 7 different removals. However, the output only changes in 2 out of 7 cases when "," is removed. This suggests that "," has a very low influence on the output. Importance: 20

6. ".": This punctuation mark appears in 5 different removals. However, the output only changes in 1 out of 5 cases when "." is removed. This suggests that "." has a very low influence on the output. Importance: 10

7. "Back": This word appears in 2 different removals. However, the output does not change in either case when "back" is removed. This suggests that "back" has no influence on the output. Importance: 0

Final rank: will, ever, never, go, ,, ., back
