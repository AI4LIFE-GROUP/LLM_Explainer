Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "def", "coming", "back", "next", and "to". These words, when removed, consistently result in a change in output of -1. This suggests that these words are important in driving the output of the model. 

On the other hand, the words "bowl", "time", and parts of the phrase "coming back to bowl next time" do not seem to have a significant impact on the output, as their removal results in no change in output. 

However, it's important to note that the importance of a word can also be context-dependent. In this case, the words "def", "coming", "back", "next", and "to" seem to be important in the context of the original sentence. 

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "def", "coming", and "back". 

Final ranking: def, coming, back.
