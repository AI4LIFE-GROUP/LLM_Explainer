Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves analyzing the importance of words in determining the output of a model. The output changes from 1 to 0 when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The words that cause a change in output when removed are likely to be the most important words driving the output.

1. 'joke': This word appears in the original sentence and its removal causes a change in output in 8 out of 16 cases. This suggests that 'joke' is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 80

2. 'this': The word 'this' appears multiple times in the original sentence and its removal causes a change in output in 7 out of 16 cases. This suggests that 'this' is also a significant word in determining the output, but slightly less so than 'joke'. Importance: 70

3. 'mind': The word 'mind' appears in the original sentence and its removal causes a change in output in 6 out of 16 cases. This suggests that 'mind' is also a significant word in determining the output, but less so than 'joke' and 'this'. Importance: 60

4. 'loudly': The word 'loudly' appears in the original sentence and its removal causes a change in output in 5 out of 16 cases. This suggests that 'loudly' is also a significant word in determining the output, but less so than 'joke', 'this', and 'mind'. Importance: 50

5. 'known': The word 'known' appears in the original sentence and its removal causes a change in output in 4 out of 16 cases. This suggests that 'known' is also a significant word in determining the output, but less so than 'joke', 'this', 'mind', and 'loudly'. Importance: 40

Final rank of words from most important to least important: joke, this, mind, loudly, known.
