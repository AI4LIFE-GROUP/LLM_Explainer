Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The words that cause a change in output when removed are likely to be the most important words driving the output. 

1. "Both": This word appears in 11 of the 16 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests that it is a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 85

2. "Unbelievably": This word appears in 10 of the 16 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests that it is also a significant word in determining the output. Importance: 80

3. "Good": This word appears in 9 of the 16 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests that it is a significant word in determining the output, but slightly less so than "both" and "unbelievably". Importance: 75

4. "Truly": This word appears in 8 of the 16 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests that it is a significant word in determining the output, but less so than "both", "unbelievably", and "good". Importance: 70

5. "Them": This word appears in 7 of the 16 removals that result in a change in output. This suggests that it is a significant word in determining the output, but less so than the other words analyzed. Importance: 65

Based on this analysis, the running rank of the words from most important to least important is: "Both", "Unbelievably", "Good", "Truly", "Them".

Both, Unbelievably, Good, Truly, Them
