Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'we', 'were', and 'promptly'. 

The word 'we' appears in 10 out of 16 removals, and in 8 of those cases, the output changes by -1. This suggests a strong negative correlation between the presence of 'we' and the output. Therefore, 'we' is likely to be a key word driving the output. I would rate its importance as 90.

The word 'were' appears in 9 out of 16 removals, and in 7 of those cases, the output changes by -1. This also suggests a strong negative correlation between the presence of 'were' and the output. Therefore, 'were' is also likely to be a key word driving the output. I would rate its importance as 85.

The word 'promptly' appears in 5 out of 16 removals, and in 4 of those cases, the output changes by -1. This suggests a strong negative correlation between the presence of 'promptly' and the output. Therefore, 'promptly' is also likely to be a key word driving the output. I would rate its importance as 80.

The other words ('greeted', 'and', 'seated', '.') do not seem to have as strong a correlation with the output. They appear in a number of removals, but the output does not consistently change when they are removed. Therefore, I would rate their importance as less than 80.

Based on this analysis, the running rank of the words from most important to least important is: 'we', 'were', 'promptly', 'greeted', 'and', 'seated', '.'.

we, were, promptly
