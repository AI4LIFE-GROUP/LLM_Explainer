Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves identifying the words that have the most influence on the model's output. This is done by observing the change in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output indicates that the removed words had some influence on the model's output. 

1. 'Said': This word appears in almost all the sentences where the output changes. When 'said' is removed, the output changes, indicating that it has a high influence on the model's output. Importance: 90

2. 'Sauce': This word also appears frequently in the sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as 'said'. Importance: 80

3. 'Yum': This word appears in many sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as 'said' or 'sauce'. Importance: 70

4. 'Eel': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as 'said', 'sauce', or 'yum'. Importance: 60

5. 'Mayo': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as the other words. Importance: 50

6. 'Descriptions': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as the other words. Importance: 40

7. 'Another': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as the other words. Importance: 30

8. 'Spicy': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as the other words. Importance: 20

9. 'Rolls': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as the other words. Importance: 10

10. 'The': This word appears in some sentences where the output changes. However, it is not as consistent as the other words. Importance: 5

Final Rank: Said, Sauce, Yum, Eel, Mayo, Descriptions, Another, Spicy, Rolls, The.
