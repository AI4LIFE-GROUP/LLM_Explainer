Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "if", "look", and "else". 

The word "if" appears in 8 of the 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "if" has a significant impact on the output. 

The word "look" appears in 6 of the 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "look" also has a significant impact on the output. 

The word "else" appears in 6 of the 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "else" also has a significant impact on the output. 

The words "you", "for", "authentic", "thai", "food", and "go" appear in multiple removals, but the output does not consistently change when they are removed. This suggests that these words have less impact on the output. 

The words "where" and "," appear in multiple removals, but the output does not change when they are removed. This suggests that these words have little to no impact on the output. 

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "if", "look", and "else". 

if, look, else
