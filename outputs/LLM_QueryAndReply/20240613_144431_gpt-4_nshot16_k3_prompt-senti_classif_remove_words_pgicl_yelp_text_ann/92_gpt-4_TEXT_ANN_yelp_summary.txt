Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The output changes by -1 when any word is removed except for "was", ".", "a", and "ri". This suggests that these four words have less influence on the model's output. 

Among the remaining words, "the", "style", "calamari", and "joke" seem to have the most influence on the model's output as their removal consistently results in a change in output. 

However, it's important to note that the removal of "the" and "style" together doesn't result in a change in output, suggesting that these words might have less individual influence and more combined influence. 

On the other hand, the removal of "calamari" and "joke" individually or together always results in a change in output, suggesting that these words have a strong individual influence on the model's output.

Based on this analysis, I would rank the words as follows:

1. "calamari" and "joke" - These words seem to have the most individual influence on the model's output.
2. "the" and "style" - These words seem to have less individual influence but a strong combined influence on the model's output.
3. "was", ".", "a", and "ri" - These words seem to have the least influence on the model's output.

calamari, joke, the, style, was, ., a, ri
