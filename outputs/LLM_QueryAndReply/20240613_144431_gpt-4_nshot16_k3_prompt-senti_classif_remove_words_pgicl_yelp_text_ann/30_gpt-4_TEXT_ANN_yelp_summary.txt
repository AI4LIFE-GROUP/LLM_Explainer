Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that appear most frequently in the removed words list when there is a change in output are 'crêpe', 'delicate', and 'moist'. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the model's output. 

1. 'Crêpe': This word appears in 8 out of 9 instances where there is a change in output. This suggests that it has a high influence on the model's output. Rating: 90

2. 'Delicate': This word appears in 7 out of 9 instances where there is a change in output. This suggests that it has a significant influence on the model's output, but slightly less than 'crêpe'. Rating: 80

3. 'Moist': This word appears in 6 out of 9 instances where there is a change in output. This suggests that it has a significant influence on the model's output, but less than 'crêpe' and 'delicate'. Rating: 70

4. 'Thin': This word appears in 5 out of 9 instances where there is a change in output. This suggests that it has a moderate influence on the model's output. Rating: 60

5. 'Was' and 'And': These words appear in 4 out of 9 instances where there is a change in output. This suggests that they have a moderate influence on the model's output. Rating: 50

6. 'The': This word appears in 3 out of 9 instances where there is a change in output. This suggests that it has a low influence on the model's output. Rating: 40

Based on this analysis, the running rank of the words from most important to least important is: 'Crêpe', 'Delicate', 'Moist', 'Thin', 'Was', 'And', 'The'.

Crêpe, Delicate, Moist
