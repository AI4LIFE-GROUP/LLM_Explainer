Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 (no change) or -1 (negative change). 

1. "I": This word is removed in 8 instances, and in each case, the output changes negatively. This suggests that "I" is a significant word in driving the output. Importance: 90

2. "Ordered": This word is removed in 7 instances. In 4 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 3, there is no change. This suggests that "ordered" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

3. "Albondigas Soup": This phrase is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 3, there is no change. This suggests that "Albondigas Soup" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

4. "Warm": This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 4, there is no change. This suggests that "warm" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

5. "Tasted": This word is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 3, there is no change. This suggests that "tasted" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

6. "Tomato": This word is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 3, there is no change. This suggests that "tomato" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

7. "With": This word is removed in 8 instances. In 4 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 4, there is no change. This suggests that "with" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

8. "Frozen": This word is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 3, there is no change. This suggests that "frozen" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

9. "Meatballs": This word is removed in 6 instances. In 3 of these, the output changes negatively, while in 3, there is no change. This suggests that "meatballs" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 70

Based on the analysis, the word "I" has the highest importance in driving the output, followed by "ordered", "Albondigas Soup", "warm", "tasted", "tomato", "with", "frozen", and "meatballs", which all have equal importance.

Final Rank: I, ordered, Albondigas Soup, warm, tasted, tomato, with, frozen, meatballs
