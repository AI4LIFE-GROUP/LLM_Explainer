Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows the words removed from the original sentence and the corresponding change in output. The change in output is either 0 or -1, indicating that the removal of certain words has a negative impact on the model's output. 

1. "Chips": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "chips" is a significant word in the sentence. Importance: 80

2. "Salsa": This word appears in all removals, and in half of them, the output changes. This suggests that "salsa" is also a significant word, but less so than "chips". Importance: 70

3. "Were": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "were" is a significant word in the sentence, but less so than "chips" and "salsa". Importance: 60

4. "Really": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "really" is a significant word in the sentence, but less so than "chips", "salsa", and "were". Importance: 50

5. "Good": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "good" is a significant word in the sentence, but less so than "chips", "salsa", "were", and "really". Importance: 40

6. "The": This word appears in all removals, and in half of them, the output changes. This suggests that "the" is also a significant word, but less so than the others. Importance: 30

7. "And": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "and" is a significant word in the sentence, but less so than the others. Importance: 20

8. "Fresh": This word appears in 8 out of 16 removals, and in each case, the output changes. This suggests that "fresh" is a significant word in the sentence, but less so than the others. Importance: 10

Final rank: Chips, Salsa, Were, Really, Good, The, And, Fresh.
