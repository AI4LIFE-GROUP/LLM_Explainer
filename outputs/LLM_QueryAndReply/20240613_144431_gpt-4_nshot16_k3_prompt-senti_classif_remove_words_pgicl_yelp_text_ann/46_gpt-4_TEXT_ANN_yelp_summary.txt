Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that when certain words are removed from the original sentence, there is a change in the model's output. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the output. 

1. "Blown up": This phrase appears in the removed words list multiple times and each time it is removed, there is a change in output. This suggests that it has a high importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 90.

2. "Honestly": This word also appears multiple times in the removed words list and each time it is removed, there is a change in output. This suggests that it also has a high importance in determining the output. However, it appears less frequently than "blown up", so I would rate its importance as 80.

3. "Should": This word appears in the removed words list a few times and each time it is removed, there is a change in output. This suggests that it has some importance in determining the output. However, it appears less frequently than "blown up" and "honestly", so I would rate its importance as 70.

4. "Place": This word appears in the removed words list a few times and each time it is removed, there is a change in output. This suggests that it has some importance in determining the output. However, it appears less frequently than "blown up", "honestly", and "should", so I would rate its importance as 60.

5. "This": This word appears in the removed words list a few times and each time it is removed, there is no change in output. This suggests that it has little to no importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 10.

6. "Be": This word appears in the removed words list a few times and each time it is removed, there is no change in output. This suggests that it has little to no importance in determining the output. I would rate its importance as 10.

Based on this analysis, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is: blown up, honestly, should, place, this, be. 

Blown up, honestly, should
