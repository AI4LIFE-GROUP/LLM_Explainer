Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'didn', 't', and 'help'. This is because whenever these words are removed, there is a change in the output. 

1. 'didn': This word seems to be very important in determining the output. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, its importance rating would be 100.

2. 't': This word also seems to be very important. Like 'didn', whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, its importance rating would also be 100.

3. 'help': This word seems to be important as well. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, its importance rating would be 100.

The words 'the', 'warm', 'beer', and '.' do not seem to have any impact on the output as their removal does not result in any change in the output. Therefore, their importance rating would be 0.

Final rank: didn, t, help, the, warm, beer, .
