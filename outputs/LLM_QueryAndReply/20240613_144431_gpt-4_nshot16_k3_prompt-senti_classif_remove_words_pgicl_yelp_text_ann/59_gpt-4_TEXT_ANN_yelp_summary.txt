Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. This change in output can be used to infer the importance of the removed words in determining the output. 

1. "All": The removal of "all" does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

2. "The bread is made in-house !": The removal of this phrase changes the output (1), indicating that it is important in determining the output. However, this phrase contains multiple words, so it's difficult to determine the importance of each individual word at this point.

3. "The !": The removal of "the !" does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

4. "The in-house !": The removal of this phrase does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

5. "All the bread is": The removal of this phrase changes the output (1), indicating that it is important in determining the output. 

6. "The in-house": The removal of this phrase does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

7. "All the is made": The removal of this phrase does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

8. "The is made !": The removal of this phrase does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

9. "All the is made in-house": The removal of this phrase does not change the output (0), suggesting that it has a low importance in determining the output. 

Based on this analysis, the most important words in determining the output appear to be "bread", "made", and "in-house", as the removal of these words consistently results in a change in output. 

Final Rank: bread, made, in-house
