Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "tacos", "Mexican", and "street". 

1. "Tacos": This word appears in all the sentences where the output changes to 1 when removed. This suggests that it has a strong positive correlation with the output. Its importance rating would be around 90.

2. "Mexican": This word also appears in all the sentences where the output changes to 1 when removed. However, it doesn't seem to have as strong of an impact as "tacos" because there are instances where it is present and the output is 0. Its importance rating would be around 80.

3. "Street": This word appears in most of the sentences where the output changes to 1 when removed. However, there are instances where it is present and the output is 0, suggesting it has a weaker correlation than "tacos" and "Mexican". Its importance rating would be around 70.

The other words in the sentences don't seem to have as strong of an impact on the output. They either appear in both types of sentences (output 0 and 1) or don't appear consistently in the sentences where the output changes to 1 when removed.

Final rank: Tacos, Mexican, Street
