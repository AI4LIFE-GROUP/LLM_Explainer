Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
Based on the dataset, it appears that the removal of any word or combination of words from the original sentence "Service was fantastic." does not result in any change in the model's output. This is indicated by the 'Change in output' value consistently being 0, regardless of the words removed. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that none of the words in the sentence have a significant influence on the model's output. In other words, all words in the sentence - 'service', 'was', and 'fantastic' - have an equal importance of 0 on a scale of 0-100 in determining the output. 

Given this, it is not possible to rank the words based on their importance in driving the output as they all have the same level of influence, which is none. 

service, was, fantastic
