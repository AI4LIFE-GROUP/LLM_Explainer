Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The analysis of the dataset shows that the words 'every', 'time', and 'Vegas' are the most important in driving the output. 

1. 'Every': This word appears in 8 instances where the output changes. In all these instances, the removal of the word 'every' leads to a change in output, indicating a strong correlation. Therefore, its importance rating is high, around 90.

2. 'Time': Similar to 'every', the word 'time' also appears in 8 instances where the output changes. The removal of 'time' also leads to a change in output, indicating a strong correlation. Therefore, its importance rating is also high, around 90.

3. 'Vegas': The word 'Vegas' appears in 7 instances where the output changes. The removal of 'Vegas' leads to a change in output, indicating a strong correlation. Therefore, its importance rating is slightly lower than 'every' and 'time', around 85.

The other words in the dataset do not show as strong a correlation with the output change as these three words. Therefore, they are ranked lower in importance.

Final Rank: every, time, Vegas.
