Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are 'flavor', 'undercooked', and 'dry'. This is because when these words are removed, the output changes significantly. 

1. 'Flavor': This word appears in many of the sentences where the output changes. When it is removed, the output often decreases by 1. This suggests that it is a key word in determining the output. Importance: 90

2. 'Undercooked': This word also appears in many of the sentences where the output changes. However, it does not seem to be as influential as 'flavor', as there are some instances where its removal does not affect the output. Importance: 80

3. 'Dry': This word appears in several sentences where the output changes. However, like 'undercooked', its removal does not always affect the output. Importance: 70

4. 'Lacked': This word appears in several sentences where the output changes. However, its removal does not always affect the output. Importance: 60

5. 'Seemed': This word appears in a few sentences where the output changes. However, its removal does not always affect the output. Importance: 50

6. 'It': This word appears in several sentences where the output changes. However, its removal does not always affect the output. Importance: 40

7. ',': This punctuation mark appears in all sentences, but its removal does not affect the output. Importance: 30

8. 'And': This word appears in several sentences where the output changes. However, its removal does not always affect the output. Importance: 20

9. '.': This punctuation mark appears in all sentences, but its removal does not affect the output. Importance: 10

Based on this analysis, the final rank of the words from most important to least important is: flavor, undercooked, dry, lacked, seemed, it, ',', and, .
