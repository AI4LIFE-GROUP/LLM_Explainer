Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The task involves identifying the most important words that drive the output of a model. The output changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The change in output is either 1 or 0, with 1 indicating a significant change and 0 indicating no change. 

1. "I": This word appears in 10 removal sets, with 5 resulting in a change in output and 5 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "I" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

2. "Am": This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "Am" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

3. "Far": This word appears in 6 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 2 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "Far" has a higher influence on the output. Importance: 67

4. "From": This word appears in 7 removal sets, with 3 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "From" has a lower influence on the output. Importance: 43

5. "A": This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "A" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

6. "Sushi": This word appears in 6 removal sets, with 3 resulting in a change in output and 3 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "Sushi" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

7. "Connoisseur": This word appears in 6 removal sets, with 3 resulting in a change in output and 3 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "Connoisseur" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

8. "But": This word appears in 7 removal sets, with 3 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "But" has a lower influence on the output. Importance: 43

9. "Can": This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "Can" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

10. "Definitely": This word appears in 8 removal sets, with 4 resulting in a change in output and 4 not resulting in a change. This suggests that "Definitely" has a moderate influence on the output. Importance: 50

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are "Far", "I", and "Am".

Final Rank: Far, I, Am
