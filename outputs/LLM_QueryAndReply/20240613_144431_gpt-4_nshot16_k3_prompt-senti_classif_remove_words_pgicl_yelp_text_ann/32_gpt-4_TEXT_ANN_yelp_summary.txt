Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words from the original sentence causes a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 or 1, with 1 indicating a significant change and 0 indicating no change. 

1. 'An': The removal of 'an' does not seem to have any effect on the output as it is always removed in combination with other words. Therefore, its importance is 0.

2. 'Absolute': The removal of 'absolute' always results in a change in output, whether it is removed alone or in combination with other words. Therefore, its importance is 100.

3. 'Must': The removal of 'must' does not seem to have any effect on the output as it is always removed in combination with other words. Therefore, its importance is 0.

4. 'Visit': The removal of 'visit' does not seem to have any effect on the output as it is always removed in combination with other words. Therefore, its importance is 0.

5. '!': The removal of '!' does not seem to have any effect on the output as it is always removed in combination with other words. Therefore, its importance is 0.

Based on this analysis, the ranking of the words from most important to least important is as follows:

Absolute, An, Must, Visit, !
