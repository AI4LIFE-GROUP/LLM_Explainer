Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are "atmosphere", "was", and ".". This is because every time these words are removed, there is a change in output. 

The word "restaurant" seems to have no impact on the output as its removal does not cause any change in output. 

The words "the" and "exquisite" seem to have some impact, but not as much as "atmosphere", "was", and ".". This is because their removal sometimes causes a change in output and sometimes does not. 

Therefore, based on the frequency of change in output when these words are removed, I would rank the words as follows:

1. "atmosphere"
2. "was"
3. "."
4. "the"
5. "exquisite"
6. "restaurant"

atmosphere, was, ., the, exquisite, restaurant
