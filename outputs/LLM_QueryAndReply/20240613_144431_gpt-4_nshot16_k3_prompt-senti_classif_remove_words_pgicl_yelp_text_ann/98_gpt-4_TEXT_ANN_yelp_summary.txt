Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The words that seem to have the most impact on the output are those that, when removed, cause a change in output. In this case, the words that cause a change in output when removed are 'would', 'again', 'if', 'i', 'sushi', 'had', 'a', 'craving', 'while', 'in', 'back', 'come', 'vegas', and '.'. 

However, not all these words have the same level of impact. Some words like 'would', 'again', 'if', 'i', 'sushi', 'had', 'a', 'craving', 'while', 'in', 'back', 'come', 'vegas', and '.' appear multiple times in the removed words list and cause a change in output, indicating that they have a higher impact on the output. 

On the other hand, words like 'back', 'come', 'vegas', and '.' appear less frequently in the removed words list and cause a change in output, indicating that they have a lower impact on the output. 

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words driving the output are 'would', 'again', and 'if'. These words appear most frequently in the removed words list and cause a change in output, indicating that they have the highest impact on the output.

Final Rank: would, again, if
