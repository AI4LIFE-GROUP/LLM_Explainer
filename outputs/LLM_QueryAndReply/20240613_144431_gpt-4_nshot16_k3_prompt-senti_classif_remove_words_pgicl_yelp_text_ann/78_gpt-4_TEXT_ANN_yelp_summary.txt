Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of certain words or phrases from the original sentence results in a change in the model's output. The change in output is either 0 (no change) or -1 (negative change). 

1. "We got sitting fairly fast" - This phrase seems to be of high importance. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, it has a high negative correlation with the output. Importance: 90

2. "But" - This word also seems to be of high importance. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, it has a high negative correlation with the output. Importance: 85

3. "Ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order" - This phrase is also of high importance. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, it has a high negative correlation with the output. Importance: 80

4. "Another 30 minutes before the food arrived" - This phrase is also of high importance. Whenever it is removed, the output changes. Therefore, it has a high negative correlation with the output. Importance: 75

5. "40" - This word seems to be of low importance. Its removal does not result in a change in output. Therefore, it has a low correlation with the output. Importance: 10

6. "Just order another" - This phrase seems to be of low importance. Its removal does not result in a change in output. Therefore, it has a low correlation with the output. Importance: 15

7. ", but ended waiting 40 to place our order , 30" - This phrase seems to be of low importance. Its removal does not result in a change in output. Therefore, it has a low correlation with the output. Importance: 20

Based on the above analysis, the top three most important words/phrases driving the output are "We got sitting fairly fast", "But", and "Ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order".

We got sitting fairly fast, But, Ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order
