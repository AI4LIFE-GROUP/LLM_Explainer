For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive change in A: 0.034, -0.093, 0.018, 0.147, 0.018, 0.014, 0.075, -0.062, 0.094, -0.012
Instances with negative change in A: -0.034, -0.075, 0.018, -0.020, -0.034, -0.062

From the instances, it seems that positive changes in A generally lead to a positive change in the output, while negative changes in A tend to result in a negative change in the output. This suggests that feature A has a significant influence on the model's output.

b. Importance rating: 80
Based on the observed positive and negative correlations, feature A seems to have a strong influence on the output. Therefore, it can be assigned a high importance rating of 80.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive change in B: -0.034, 0.034, -0.107, -0.117, -0.001, -0.002, -0.081, -0.096, -0.120, 0.088
Instances with negative change in B: -0.081

The instances show that both positive and negative changes in B can lead to both positive and negative changes in the output. However, the number of instances with positive changes in B is higher than those with negative changes. This suggests that feature B has a moderate influence on the output.

b. Importance rating: 60
Considering both positive and negative correlations, feature B can be assigned a moderate importance rating of 60.
