For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative. We will also rate the importance of each feature on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: -0.156, -0.144, 0.121, 0.120, -0.104, 0.092, 0.192, -0.079, 0.012, -0.134, 0.115, -0.061, -0.146
Instances with negative changes in A: -0.103
The instances with positive changes in A have mixed effects on the output, with some resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). The instance with a negative change in A also resulted in a change of -1. Therefore, the change in A does not consistently correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 50
Based on the mixed effects observed, we can assign an importance rating of 50 to feature A. It has an equal likelihood of positively or negatively influencing the output.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.014, 0.020, 0.001, 0.109, 0.031, 0.036, 0.094, -0.001, 0.057, -0.110, 0.047, 0.203, 0.065, 0.062, 0.037
Instances with negative changes in B: -0.065
The instances with positive changes in B have mixed effects on the output, with some resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). The instance with a negative change in B also resulted in a change of -1. Therefore, the change in B does not consistently correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 50
Similar to feature A, feature B also has mixed effects on the output. Hence, it receives an importance rating of 50.

3. Feature C:
a. Instances with positive changes in C: -0.148, 0.147, -0.095, -0.109, 0.096, 0.030, -0.119, 0.096, 0.041, 0.044, -0.075, 0.060, -0.013
Instances with negative changes in C: -0.053, 0.255
The instances with positive changes in C have mixed effects on the output, with some resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). The instances with negative changes in C also have mixed effects, with one resulting in a change of -1 and the other resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in C does not consistently correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 50
Similar to features A and B, feature C also has mixed effects on the output. It receives an importance rating of 50.

4. Feature D:
a. Instances with positive changes in D: -0.277, 0.267, 0.318, 0.342, -0.323, -0.352, 0.307, 0.284, -0.377, 0.257, 0.332, -0.314, -0.342
Instances with negative changes in D: -0.328
The instances with positive changes in D have mixed effects on the output, with some resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). The instance with a negative change in D also resulted in a change of -1. Therefore, the change in D does not consistently correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 50
Feature D, similar to the previous features, has mixed effects on the output. It receives an importance rating of 50.

5. Feature E:
a. Instances with positive changes in E: -0.074, 0.087, 0.014, 0.171, 0.137, -0.178, 0.051, 0.092, 0.076, 0.074, -0.058, 0.057, 0.035, 0.030

The instances with positive and negative changes in E have consistent effects on the output, resulting in no change (0) in all cases. Therefore, the change in E does not correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 0
Since the change in E does not have any correlation with the change in output, it receives an importance rating of 0.

6. Feature F:
a. Instances with positive changes in F: -0.145, -0.105, 0.106, 0.002, 0.187, -0.055, -0.073, 0.082, 0.039, -0.005, -0.026, 0.030, 0.035
Instances with negative changes in F: -0.105, 0.104, -0.051, -0.027, 0.141, -0.164, 0.044
The instances with positive changes in F have mixed effects on the output, with some resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). The instances with negative changes in F also have mixed effects, with some resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in F does not consistently correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 50
Feature F, similar to the previous features, has mixed effects on the output. It receives an importance rating of 50.

7. Feature G:
a. Instances with positive changes in G: 0.048, 0.373, -0.009, 0.138, 0.060, 0.064, 0.076, -0.184, 0.228, 0.054, -0.032, 0.090, 0.019, 0.072

The instances with positive and negative changes in G have consistent effects on the output, resulting in no change (0) in all cases. Therefore, the change in G does not correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 0
Since the change in G does not have any correlation with the change in output, it receives an importance rating of 0.

8. Feature H:
a. Instances with positive changes in H: -0.105, 0.052, 0.157, 0.008, -0.008, -0.013, -0.048, -0.071, -0.071, 0.119, 0.055, 0.044, -0.208, -0.222

The instances with positive and negative changes in H have consistent effects on the output, resulting in no change (0) in all cases. Therefore, the change in H does not correlate with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 0
Since the change in H does not have any correlation with the change in output, it receives an importance rating of 0.

9. Feature I:
a. Instances with positive changes in I: 0.143, 0.095, -0.268, -0.089, 0.017, 0.062, 0.122, -0.037, -0.044, 0.064, -0.098, 0.042, 0.148, -0.073
