For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative. We will also rate the importance of each feature on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: -0.129, 0.022, -0.110, -0.049, 0.035, 0.144, -0.062, -0.095, -0.156, -0.003, -0.075, 0.062, -0.047, -0.088, -0.031
b. Instances with negative changes in A: 0.105, 0.020, 0.151, 0.046, 0.071, -0.103, -0.111, -0.194, -0.077, 0.063, -0.159, 0.068, -0.036, -0.081, 0.024
The change in output seems to be negatively correlated with positive changes in A and positively correlated with negative changes in A. This suggests that an increase in A tends to decrease the output, while a decrease in A tends to increase the output.

Rating: 70
Justification: The correlation between A and the output is consistent across instances, indicating a moderate importance in determining the output.

Running rank: A

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.105, 0.020, 0.151, 0.046, 0.071, -0.103, -0.111, -0.194, -0.077, 0.063, -0.159, 0.068, -0.036, -0.081, 0.024
b. Instances with negative changes in B: -0.129, 0.022, -0.110, -0.049, 0.035, 0.144, -0.062, -0.095, -0.156, -0.003, -0.075, 0.062, -0.047, -0.088, -0.031
The change in output seems to be positively correlated with positive changes in B and negatively correlated with negative changes in B. This suggests that an increase in B tends to increase the output, while a decrease in B tends to decrease the output.

Rating: 80
Justification: The correlation between B and the output is consistent across instances, indicating a relatively high importance in determining the output.

Running rank: BA

3. Feature C:
a. Instances with positive changes in C: -0.285, -0.097, 0.088, 0.119, -0.008, -0.206, -0.066, 0.022, -0.037, 0.014, -0.124, -0.072, -0.062, -0.194, -0.253, 0.071
b. Instances with negative changes in C: 0.105, 0.020, 0.151, 0.046, 0.071, -0.103, -0.111, -0.194, -0.077, 0.063, -0.159, 0.068, -0.036, -0.081, 0.024
The change in output does not show a consistent correlation with positive or negative changes in C. There is no clear pattern indicating a strong influence of C on the output.

Rating: 40
Justification: The correlation between C and the output is not consistent across instances, indicating a relatively low importance in determining the output.

Running rank: BAC

4. Feature D:
a. Instances with positive changes in D: -0.256, -0.271, 0.441, 0.338, 0.295, -0.245, -0.291, 0.376, 0.357, -0.311, 0.408, 0.415, -0.280, -0.278, -0.465, 0.333

The change in output seems to be positively correlated with positive changes in D and negatively correlated with negative changes in D. This suggests that an increase in D tends to increase the output, while a decrease in D tends to decrease the output.

Rating: 90
Justification: The correlation between D and the output is consistent across instances, indicating a high importance in determining the output.

Running rank: BACD

5. Feature E:
a. Instances with positive changes in E: -0.078, -0.046, -0.042, 0.158, 0.081, -0.233, -0.158, -0.087, 0.044, -0.097, 0.052, 0.061, -0.129, -0.062, -0.081, -0.038

The change in output does not show a consistent correlation with positive or negative changes in E. There is no clear pattern indicating a strong influence of E on the output.

Rating: 40
Justification: The correlation between E and the output is not consistent across instances, indicating a relatively low importance in determining the output.

The change in output seems to be positively correlated with positive changes in F and negatively correlated with negative changes in F. This suggests that an increase in F tends to increase the output, while a decrease in F tends to decrease the output.

Rating: 80
Justification: The correlation between F and the output is consistent across instances, indicating a relatively high importance in determining the output.

Running rank: BACDEF

7. Feature G:
