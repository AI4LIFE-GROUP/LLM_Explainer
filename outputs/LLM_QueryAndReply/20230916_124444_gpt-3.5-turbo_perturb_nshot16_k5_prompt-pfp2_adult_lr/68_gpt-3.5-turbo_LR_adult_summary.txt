For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative. We will also rate the importance of each feature on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: 0.038, -0.017, 0.115, 0.103
   Instances with negative changes in A: -0.180, -0.067, -0.070, -0.105, -0.012, -0.028, -0.152, -0.039, 0.000, -0.062, 0.103, -0.117

   From the instances, we can observe that when A has positive changes, the output can be both positive and negative. Similarly, when A has negative changes, the output can also be both positive and negative. There is no consistent correlation between the change in A and the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 50

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.034, 0.020, 0.077, -0.040, -0.043, -0.055, 0.044, -0.139, 0.094, -0.064, 0.184, -0.044, 0.113
   Instances with negative changes in B: 0.034, 0.020, 0.077, -0.040, -0.043, -0.055, 0.044, -0.139, 0.094, -0.064, 0.184, -0.044, 0.113

   Interestingly, all instances have the same changes in B, both positive and negative. This indicates that the change in B does not have any influence on the output.

b. Importance rating: 0

3. Feature C:
a. Instances with positive changes in C: -0.058, -0.183, 0.058, 0.140, 0.114, 0.003, 0.058, 0.157, 0.048, -0.162, -0.069, 0.047, -0.274, -0.029, -0.183, -0.010

   Similar to feature B, all instances have the same changes in C, both positive and negative. This suggests that the change in C does not have a significant impact on the output.

b. Importance rating: 0

4. Feature D:
a. Instances with positive changes in D: -0.313, -0.320, 0.324, 0.319, 0.301, -0.353, -0.338, 0.383, 0.309, -0.302, 0.335, 0.328, -0.280, -0.288, -0.332, 0.346
   Instances with negative changes in D: -0.313, -0.320, 0.324, 0.319, 0.301, -0.353, -0.338, 0.383, 0.309, -0.302, 0.335, 0.328, -0.280, -0.288, -0.332, 0.346

   The changes in D are consistent across all instances, both positive and negative. This indicates that the change in D does not have a strong correlation with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 10

5. Feature E:
a. Instances with positive changes in E: -0.050, 0.049, 0.027, -0.151, 0.180, 0.048, -0.125, 0.001, 0.129, -0.051, 0.122, 0.039, 0.108

   The changes in F are consistent across all instances, both positive and negative. This indicates that the change in F does not have a strong correlation with the change in output.

b. Importance rating: 5

7. Feature G:
a. Instances with positive changes in G: -0.089, -0.068, 0.202, -0.111, 0.074, -0.035, 0.152, -0.159, -0.042, 0.033, -0.021
