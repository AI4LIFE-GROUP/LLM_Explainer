Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is positive for the first two instances where the output is 1 and negative for the last two instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation. Importance: 70

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is negative for the first instance where the output is 1, positive for the second instance where the output is 1, and positive for the third instance where the output is 0. This suggests a weak correlation. Importance: 30. Rank after 'A': AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is negative for all instances, regardless of the output. This suggests a strong negative correlation. Importance: 90. Rank after 'B': CAB

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is positive for the first two instances where the output is 1 and negative for the last two instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation. Importance: 70. Rank after 'C': CADB

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is negative for the first and third instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively, and positive for the second instance where the output is 1. This suggests a weak correlation. Importance: 40. Rank after 'D': CADBE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is positive for the first two instances where the output is 1 and negative for the last two instances where the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation. Importance: 70. Rank after 'E': CADBFE

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is positive for the first and fourth instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively, and negative for the second and third instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively. This suggests a weak correlation. Importance: 40. Rank after 'F': CADBFEG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is positive for all instances, regardless of the output. This suggests a weak positive correlation. Importance: 50. Rank after 'G': CADBFEGH

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is negative for the first two instances where the output is 1 and positive for the last two instances where the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. Importance: 70. Rank after 'H': CADBFEGHI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is positive for the first and fourth instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively, and negative for the second and third instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively. This suggests a weak correlation. Importance: 40. Rank after 'I': CADBFEGHIJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is negative for the first and fourth instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively, and positive for the second and third instances where the output is 1 and 0 respectively. This suggests a weak correlation. Importance: 40. Rank after 'J': CADBFEGHIJK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is negative for the first two instances where the output is 1 and positive for the last two instances where the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. Importance: 70. Rank after 'K': CADBFEGHIJKL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is negative for all instances, regardless of the output. This suggests a strong negative correlation. Importance: 90. Rank after 'L': MCADBFEGHIJKL

Based on the above analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: M, C, A, D, B.
