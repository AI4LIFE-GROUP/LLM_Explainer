Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In two instances, an increase in 'A' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'A' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 30

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' always corresponds to an increase or no change in output. This suggests a positive correlation. Importance: 70. Current rank: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'C' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'C' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: BAC

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. When 'D' increases, the output does not change, and when 'D' decreases, the output decreases. Importance: 80. Current rank: DBAC

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'E' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'E' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBAEC

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'F' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'F' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBAEFC

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. When 'G' decreases, the output decreases. Importance: 80. Current rank: DGBAEFC

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'H' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'H' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DGBAEFHC

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'I' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'I' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DGBAEFHIC

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'J' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'J' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DGBAEFHICJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'K' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'K' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DGBAEFHICJK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' does not have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, an increase in 'L' corresponds to no change in output, while in another instance, a decrease in 'L' corresponds to a decrease in output. The correlation is not clear. Importance: 40. Current rank: DGBAEFHICJKL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. When 'M' decreases, the output decreases, and when 'M' increases, the output does not change. Importance: 80. Current rank: DGMBAEFHICJKL

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, G, M, B, A, E, F, H, I, C, J, K, L.
