Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the first and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the second instance. The magnitude of change in 'A' is quite significant in all instances. Therefore, the importance of 'A' is high. Rating: 80.

2. Feature 'B': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third instance and a positive correlation in the second and fourth instances. The magnitude of change in 'B' is not as significant as 'A'. Therefore, the importance of 'B' is lower than 'A'. Rating: 60. Running rank: AB.

3. Feature 'C': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the first and second instances. The magnitude of change in 'C' is significant in all instances. Therefore, the importance of 'C' is high, similar to 'A'. Rating: 80. Running rank: ACB.

4. Feature 'D': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the first and second instances. The magnitude of change in 'D' is the highest among all features. Therefore, the importance of 'D' is the highest so far. Rating: 90. Running rank: DACB.

5. Feature 'E': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the first and second instances. The magnitude of change in 'E' is significant but not as high as 'D'. Therefore, the importance of 'E' is lower than 'D' but higher than 'B'. Rating: 70. Running rank: DACEB.

6. Feature 'F': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output in the first, second, and third instances and a negative correlation in the fourth instance. The magnitude of change in 'F' is not as significant as 'D' or 'A'. Therefore, the importance of 'F' is lower than 'E'. Rating: 65. Running rank: DACEFB.

7. Feature 'G': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the first instance. The magnitude of change in 'G' is significant but not as high as 'D' or 'A'. Therefore, the importance of 'G' is lower than 'F'. Rating: 60. Running rank: DACEFBG.

8. Feature 'H': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the first and second instances. The magnitude of change in 'H' is not as significant as other features. Therefore, the importance of 'H' is lower than 'G'. Rating: 55. Running rank: DACEFBGH.

9. Feature 'I': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the second and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the third instance. The magnitude of change in 'I' is not as significant as other features. Therefore, the importance of 'I' is lower than 'H'. Rating: 50. Running rank: DACEFBGHI.

10. Feature 'J': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the fourth instance and a positive correlation in the first, second, and third instances. The magnitude of change in 'J' is significant in the second instance. Therefore, the importance of 'J' is higher than 'I' but lower than 'G'. Rating: 58. Running rank: DACEFBGJHI.

11. Feature 'K': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the third and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the first instance. The magnitude of change in 'K' is significant in the first instance. Therefore, the importance of 'K' is higher than 'J' but lower than 'B'. Rating: 62. Running rank: DACEFBKGJHI.

12. Feature 'L': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the first instance and a positive correlation in the second and fourth instances. The magnitude of change in 'L' is not as significant as other features. Therefore, the importance of 'L' is lower than 'I'. Rating: 48. Running rank: DACEFBKGJHIL.

13. Feature 'M': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the first instance and a positive correlation in the second, third, and fourth instances. The magnitude of change in 'M' is significant in the first and second instances. Therefore, the importance of 'M' is higher than 'B' but lower than 'E'. Rating: 68. Running rank: DACEFMBKGJHIL.

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, A, C, E, F, M, B, K, G, J, H, I, L.
