Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. However, the changes in 'A' are relatively small compared to other features. Importance: 40.

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' has a positive correlation with the output in the first instance and a negative correlation in the last three instances. The changes in 'B' are also relatively small. Importance: 35. Running rank: AB.

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' has a positive correlation with the output in the first instance and a negative correlation in the last three instances. The changes in 'C' are larger than 'A' and 'B'. Importance: 45. Running rank: CAB.

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' has a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The changes in 'D' are the largest among the features analyzed so far. Importance: 70. Running rank: DCAB.

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' has a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The changes in 'E' are larger than 'A', 'B', and 'C', but smaller than 'D'. Importance: 60. Running rank: D, E, C, A, B.

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' has a negative correlation with the output in the first three instances and a positive correlation in the last instance. The changes in 'F' are larger than 'A', 'B', and 'C', but smaller than 'D' and 'E'. Importance: 55. Running rank: D, E, F, C, A, B.
