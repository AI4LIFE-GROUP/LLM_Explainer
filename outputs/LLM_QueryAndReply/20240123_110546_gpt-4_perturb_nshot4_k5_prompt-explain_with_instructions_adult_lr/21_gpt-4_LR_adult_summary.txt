Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': This feature has a negative correlation with the output. The change in 'A' is negative when the output is both 1 and 0. This indicates that 'A' is an important feature. Importance: 80

2. Feature 'B': This feature has a positive correlation with the output when it is 1 and a negative correlation when the output is 0. This indicates that 'B' is also an important feature. Importance: 70. Running rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': This feature has a negative correlation with the output when it is 1 and a positive correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'C' is also an important feature. Importance: 75. Running rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D': This feature has a positive correlation with the output when it is 1 and a negative correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'D' is a very important feature. Importance: 90. Running rank: DACB

5. Feature 'E': This feature has a positive correlation with the output when it is 1 and a negative correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'E' is also an important feature. Importance: 80. Running rank: DAEBC

6. Feature 'F': This feature has a negative correlation with the output when it is 1 and a negative correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'F' is not as important as the other features. Importance: 60. Running rank: DAEBCF

7. Feature 'G': This feature has a negative correlation with the output when it is 1 and a positive correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'G' is also an important feature. Importance: 70. Running rank: DAEBCGF

8. Feature 'H': This feature has a positive correlation with the output when it is 1 and a negative correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'H' is also an important feature. Importance: 75. Running rank: DAEHBCGF

9. Feature 'I': This feature has a positive correlation with the output when it is 1 and a negative correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'I' is also an important feature. Importance: 70. Running rank: DAEHBCGIF

10. Feature 'J': This feature has a negative correlation with the output when it is 1 and a positive correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'J' is also an important feature. Importance: 75. Running rank: DAEHJBCGIF

11. Feature 'K': This feature has a positive correlation with the output when it is 1 and a positive correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'K' is not as important as the other features. Importance: 60. Running rank: DAEHJBCGIFK

12. Feature 'L': This feature has a negative correlation with the output when it is 1 and a positive correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'L' is also an important feature. Importance: 70. Running rank: DAEHJLBCGIFK

13. Feature 'M': This feature has a negative correlation with the output when it is 1 and a positive correlation when it is 0. This indicates that 'M' is also an important feature. Importance: 75. Running rank: DAEHJMLBCGIFK

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, A, E, H, J, M, L, B, C, G, I, F, K.
