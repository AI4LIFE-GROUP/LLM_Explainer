Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a mixed effect on the output. In the first and fourth instances, a decrease in 'A' corresponds to an increase and decrease in output respectively. In the second and third instances, an increase in 'A' corresponds to an increase and decrease in output respectively. The correlation is not very clear. Importance: 50

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' also has a mixed effect on the output. In the first and third instances, an increase in 'B' corresponds to an increase and decrease in output respectively. In the second instance, a decrease in 'B' corresponds to an increase in output. The correlation is not very clear. Importance: 50. Compared to 'A', 'B' is equally important. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. In all instances, a decrease in 'C' corresponds to both increase and decrease in output. Importance: 60. Compared to 'A' and 'B', 'C' is more important. Current rank: CAB

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'D' corresponds to an increase or decrease in output respectively. Importance: 80. Compared to 'C', 'A', and 'B', 'D' is more important. Current rank: DCAB

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' seems to have a mixed effect on the output. In all instances, an increase in 'E' corresponds to both increase and decrease in output. Importance: 50. Compared to 'D', 'C', 'A', and 'B', 'E' is less important. Current rank: DCABE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. In all instances, a decrease or increase in 'F' corresponds to an increase or decrease in output respectively. Importance: 70. Compared to 'D', 'C', 'A', 'B', and 'E', 'F' is more important. Current rank: DFCABE

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. In all instances, a decrease or increase in 'G' corresponds to an increase or decrease in output respectively. Importance: 70. Compared to 'D', 'F', 'C', 'A', 'B', and 'E', 'G' is equally important as 'F'. Current rank: DFGCABE

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' seems to have a mixed effect on the output. In all instances, a decrease or increase in 'H' corresponds to both increase and decrease in output. Importance: 50. Compared to 'D', 'F', 'G', 'C', 'A', 'B', and 'E', 'H' is less important. Current rank: DFGCABEH

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. In all instances, a decrease in 'I' corresponds to both increase and decrease in output. Importance: 60. Compared to 'D', 'F', 'G', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'E', and 'H', 'I' is more important. Current rank: DFGICABEH

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. In all instances, a decrease in 'J' corresponds to both increase and decrease in output.
