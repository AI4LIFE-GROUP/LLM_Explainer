Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases and decreases while the output remains the same, and it also decreases when the output decreases. Its importance is low, let's say 20.

2. Feature 'B': 'B' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when the output decreases. It seems to have a slightly higher importance than 'A', let's say 30. So far, the rank is BA.

3. Feature 'C': 'C' decreases when the output remains the same and also when it decreases. It seems to have a similar importance to 'B', let's say 30. The rank is now BCA.

4. Feature 'D': 'D' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when it decreases. It seems to have a higher importance than the previous features, let's say 40. The rank is now DBCA.

5. Feature 'E': 'E' increases and decreases when the output remains the same and decreases when the output decreases. Its importance is similar to 'A', let's say 20. The rank is now DBCAE.

6. Feature 'F': 'F' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'B', let's say 30. The rank is now DBCFAE.

7. Feature 'G': 'G' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'D', let's say 40. The rank is now GD,BCFAE.

8. Feature 'H': 'H' decreases when the output remains the same and also when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'C', let's say 30. The rank is now GD,BCFHAE.

9. Feature 'I': 'I' increases when the output remains the same and also when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'A', let's say 20. The rank is now GD,BCFHAEI.

10. Feature 'J': 'J' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'D', let's say 40. The rank is now GDJ,BCFHAEI.

11. Feature 'K': 'K' decreases when the output remains the same and increases when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'B', let's say 30. The rank is now GDJ,BCFKHAEI.

12. Feature 'L': 'L' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'C', let's say 30. The rank is now GDJ,BCFLKHAEI.

13. Feature 'M': 'M' increases when the output remains the same and decreases when it decreases. Its importance is similar to 'D', let's say 40. The rank is now GDJM,BCFLKHAEI.

Based on the above analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: G, D, J, M, B.
