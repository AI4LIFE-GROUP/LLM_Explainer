Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases, decreases, and stays the same while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' also does not have a consistent impact on the output. It increases and decreases while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a slight impact on the output. It increases when the output is 0 and decreases when the output is -1, but there are also instances where it increases and the output is -1. Importance: 40. Current rank: CAB

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a significant impact on the output. It increases when the output is 0 and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 70. Current rank: DCAB

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases, decreases, and stays the same while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30. Current rank: DCABE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' seems to have a slight impact on the output. It decreases when the output is 0 and increases when the output is -1. Importance: 40. Current rank: DCABEF

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases, decreases, and stays the same while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30. Current rank: DCABEFG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' seems to have a significant impact on the output. It increases when the output is 0 and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 70. Current rank: HDCAEFG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases, decreases, and stays the same while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30. Current rank: HDCAEFGI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases, decreases, and stays the same while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30. Current rank: HDCAEFGIJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' seems to have a slight impact on the output. It decreases when the output is 0 and increases when the output is -1. Importance: 40. Current rank: HDCAEFGIJK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. It increases, decreases, and stays the same while the output remains 0, and it both increases and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 30. Current rank: HDCAEFGIJKL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' seems to have a slight impact on the output. It increases when the output is 0 and decreases when the output is -1. Importance: 40. Current rank: HDCAEFGIJKLM

Based on the analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: H, D, C, A, E.
