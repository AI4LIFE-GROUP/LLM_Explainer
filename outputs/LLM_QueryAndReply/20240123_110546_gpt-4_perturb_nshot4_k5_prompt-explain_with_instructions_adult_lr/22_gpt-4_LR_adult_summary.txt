Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is stronger than 'A'. Importance: 60. Current rank: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is stronger than 'A' but weaker than 'B'. Importance: 55. Current rank: BCA

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a strong positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a strong negative correlation when the output is -1. Importance: 80. Current rank: DBCA

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is weaker than 'A'. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBCAE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is stronger than 'E' but weaker than 'A'. Importance: 45. Current rank: DBCAFE

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is weaker than 'F'. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBCAFEG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is stronger than 'G' but weaker than 'F'. Importance: 45. Current rank: DBCAFEHG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is weaker than 'H'. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBCAFEHGI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is weaker than 'I'. Importance: 35. Current rank: DBCAFEHGJI

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is stronger than 'J' but weaker than 'I'. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBCAFEHGKJI

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is weaker than 'K'. Importance: 35. Current rank: DBCAFEHGKJIL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The correlation is weaker than 'L'. Importance: 30. Final rank: DBCAFEHGKJILM

Based on the analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: D, B, C, A, F.
