Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, it's evident that the model's output changes based on the presence or absence of certain words. The model outputs a change (from 0 to -1) when specific words are removed, indicating their importance in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence. By comparing instances where the change in output is -1 to those with no change (0), we can deduce which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output.

1. **"worst"**: This word appears in almost all instances where its removal leads to a change in output. Its presence or absence seems to significantly influence the model's perception of the sentence's sentiment.

2. **"crap"**: The removal of this word in several instances also leads to a change in output. It seems to play a key role in the model's interpretation, likely due to its strong negative connotation.

3. **"crappy"**: Similar to "crap", this word's removal in certain contexts leads to a change in output. It's another term with a negative connotation that appears to affect the model's sentiment analysis.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

worst, crap, crappy
