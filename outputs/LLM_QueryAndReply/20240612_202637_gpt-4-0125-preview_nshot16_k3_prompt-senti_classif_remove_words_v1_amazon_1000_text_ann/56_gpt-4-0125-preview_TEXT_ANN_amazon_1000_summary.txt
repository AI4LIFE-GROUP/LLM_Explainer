Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look for patterns in the dataset where the removal of specific words leads to a change in the output. A change in output, especially a consistent one across different removals, indicates a significant impact on the model's decision-making process. 

From the dataset, we observe that the removal of certain words or symbols consistently leads to a change in output (from 0 to -1 or vice versa). Specifically, the removal of "-", "I", and "m" (from "I'm") seems to have a consistent impact on changing the model's output. 

- The dash "-" appears in several instances where its removal changes the output to -1, suggesting it plays a crucial role in the model's interpretation of the sentence.
- The word "I" is also involved in changes, but its direct impact is less clear than that of "-". However, considering its presence in combinations that lead to output changes, it holds some importance.
- The abbreviation "m" from "I'm" shows a similar pattern to "-", indicating its significance in the model's processing of the sentence.

Therefore, based on the analysis of changes in model output with the removal of words, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction appear to be:

unreliable, -, '
