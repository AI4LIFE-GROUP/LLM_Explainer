Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look at the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words have a significant impact on the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"recommend"** - The removal of "recommend" consistently leads to a change in output (to 1 when removed alone, and similar changes when removed with other words), indicating its strong influence on the model's prediction.

2. **"product"** - The removal of "product" also leads to a change in output in several instances, suggesting its importance. However, its impact seems slightly less consistent compared to "recommend," as its removal alone changes the output to 0, indicating a negative or neutral sentiment.

3. **"highly"** - The word "highly" appears to have a lesser but still noticeable impact on the model's output. Its removal, especially when combined with other words (e.g., "i highly product ."), changes the output, but its influence is not as strong as "recommend" or "product."

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, based on the provided dataset, are:

recommend, product, highly
