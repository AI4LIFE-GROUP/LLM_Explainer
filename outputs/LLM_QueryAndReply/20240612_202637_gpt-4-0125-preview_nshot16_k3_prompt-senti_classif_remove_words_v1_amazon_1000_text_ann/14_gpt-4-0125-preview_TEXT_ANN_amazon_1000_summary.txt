Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look at the instances where the removal of specific words or combinations of words leads to a change in the output. A change in output, in this case, is indicated by a shift from 0 to -1. This change suggests that the removed words are crucial for the model to maintain its original prediction.

From the dataset, we observe that the removal of "does everything the description said it would" and variations of this phrase with slight differences (like including "it" or punctuation) consistently leads to a change in output from 0 to -1. This indicates that these words are significant in the model's decision-making process. However, to pinpoint the top three specific words, we need to identify which words are common in all or most changes that lead to a negative shift in the model's output.

1. **"does"** - Its removal is a common factor in several instances that result in a change in output to -1.
2. **"everything"** - Similarly, its removal is often involved in scenarios where the output changes to -1.
3. **"said"** - This word's removal is also a common denominator in many cases leading to a negative change in output.

These words are crucial because their removal significantly impacts the model's interpretation or understanding of the sentence, leading to a different prediction. It's important to note that while other words like "the," "description," "it," and "would" are frequently removed, their removal does not consistently result in a change in output unless combined with the above-mentioned words, indicating their relatively lower importance in isolation.
