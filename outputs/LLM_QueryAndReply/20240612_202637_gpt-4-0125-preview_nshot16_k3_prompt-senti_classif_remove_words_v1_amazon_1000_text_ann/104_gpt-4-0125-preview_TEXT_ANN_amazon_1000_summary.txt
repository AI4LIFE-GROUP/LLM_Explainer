Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a baseline output) to a different value (e.g., from 0 to -1 or vice versa) indicates the importance of the removed words in that change. Words that are consistently present in removals that lead to a change in output are likely to be more influential.

1. **"not"** - The word "not" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output (e.g., "have if your state not phone while driving" and "is a have if your does not allow cell phone usage while ."). Its removal often flips the output, suggesting its importance in the sentence's sentiment or meaning.

2. **"allow"** - Similar to "not," "allow" is present in multiple instances where its removal changes the output (e.g., "this definitely a must have your state does not allow cell usage while driving ." and "a have if does not allow phone while driving ."). This suggests that the model heavily weighs the presence or absence of this word.

3. **"have"** - The word "have" is also frequently involved in changes to the model's output (e.g., "Removed words: is have if your state does not phone usage while" and "Removed words: this is definitely a must have if your cell usage while ."). Its removal seems to impact the model's interpretation of the sentence, albeit perhaps not as strongly as "not" or "allow."

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words appear to be:

not, allow, have
