Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence.

1. **Virgin Wireless**: The removal of "virgin wireless" consistently leads to a negative change in output (-1), indicating that these words are crucial for the positive sentiment of the original sentence. This is evident in multiple instances, such as when "virgin wireless" is removed alone or in combination with other words.

2. **Rocks**: The word "rocks" also appears to play a significant role. Its removal, especially when combined with "virgin wireless" and other positive sentiment words, leads to a negative change in output. This suggests that "rocks" contributes significantly to the positive sentiment of the sentence.

3. **Cheap**: The word "cheap" seems to have a lesser but still noticeable impact compared to "virgin wireless" and "rocks". Its removal in certain combinations does not always result in a change in output, but its presence in the original sentence contributes to the overall positive sentiment.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

Virgin Wireless, Rocks, Cheap
