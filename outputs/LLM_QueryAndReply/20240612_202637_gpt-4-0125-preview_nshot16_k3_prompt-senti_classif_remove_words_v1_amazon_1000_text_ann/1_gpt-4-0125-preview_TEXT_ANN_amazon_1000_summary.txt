Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe changes in the model's output based on the words removed from the original sentence. The model's output changes to -1 when certain words are removed, indicating these words have a significant impact on the model's prediction. Specifically, when the words "terrible," "product," and "waste" are removed, either individually or in combinations, the model's output tends to change to -1, suggesting a negative sentiment is lost without these words. 

For instance, removing "terrible" alone or in combination with "product" and other words leads to a change in output to -1 in multiple instances. Similarly, removing "waste" in certain contexts also results in a change to -1. On the other hand, removals that do not include these key words often result in no change in output (0), indicating these words are less critical in influencing the model's sentiment analysis.

Therefore, based on the frequency and impact of word removals on the model's output change, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

terrible, product, waste
