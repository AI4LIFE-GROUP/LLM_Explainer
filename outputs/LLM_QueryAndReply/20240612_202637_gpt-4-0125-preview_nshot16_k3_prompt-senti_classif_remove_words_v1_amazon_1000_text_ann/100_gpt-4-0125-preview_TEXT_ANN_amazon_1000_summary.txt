Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is influenced by the presence or absence of specific words in the original sentence. A change in output of "-1" indicates a significant alteration in the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for the model's understanding or interpretation of the sentence.

1. **"double"** - The removal of "double" in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance. Specifically, when "double" is removed along with other words, such as in "double same time after the" and "allows the possibility of double booking for the same date time after the first .", it results in a change in output. This suggests that "double" plays a key role in the context of booking, possibly indicating the uniqueness of the booking scenario being described.

2. **"the"** - Although a common word, its removal in different contexts ("the of the first .", "allows the the after first .", "the of double booking for the same and time after the") significantly changes the output. This implies that "the" is crucial in maintaining the structural integrity of the sentence, affecting how the model interprets the overall meaning.

3. **"of"** - Similar to "the", "of" is a common word whose removal in contexts like "the of the first ." and "of date and after the first" leads to a change in output. This suggests that "of" contributes to the semantic structure of the sentence, influencing the model's interpretation.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

double, the, of
