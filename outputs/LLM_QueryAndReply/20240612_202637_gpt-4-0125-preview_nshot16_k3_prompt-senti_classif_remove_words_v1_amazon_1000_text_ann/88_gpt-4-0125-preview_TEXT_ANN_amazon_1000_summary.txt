Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's prediction. 

1. The word "save" appears in many instances where its removal leads to a change in output (specifically, a change to -1). This suggests that "save" is a key word in determining the model's output.

2. The removal of "money" does not consistently lead to a change in output when removed with other words, indicating it might not be as influential alone. However, its presence alongside "save" in several impactful removals suggests it has some importance, but less so than "save".

3. The word "months" is part of several removals, but its direct impact is less clear compared to "save". It's included in both changes and no changes in output, suggesting it has an impact but is dependent on the context provided by other words.

Given this analysis, the top three most important words, based on their influence on the model's prediction, appear to be:

save, money, months
