Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe that the model's output changes from its baseline only when specific words are removed. The baseline output (with no words removed) is not explicitly given, but we can infer that the removal of certain words causing a change in output indicates their importance in the model's decision-making process. 

The word "horrible" consistently leads to a change in output (-1) whenever it is removed, regardless of the presence or absence of other words. This indicates that "horrible" is a key word that the model relies on to make its prediction. 

The words "it" and "was" do not seem to affect the model's output when removed, either individually or together, as the change in output is 0 in those cases. The punctuation marks "!" and "." also do not affect the output when removed, except when removed along with key words like "horrible".

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

horrible, was, it
