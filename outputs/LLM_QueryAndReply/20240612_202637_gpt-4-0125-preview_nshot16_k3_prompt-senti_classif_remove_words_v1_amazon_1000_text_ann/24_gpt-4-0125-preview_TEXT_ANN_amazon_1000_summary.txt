Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe changes in the model's output based on the words removed from the original sentence. The original sentence is "WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!." When we look at the instances where the change in output is -1, it consistently involves the removal of specific words, regardless of the punctuation or other words removed alongside them. 

The words "warning," "not," and "buy" are crucial in this context. Every time these words are removed, either individually or in combination, there is a change in output to -1. This indicates a negative sentiment or a significant shift in the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment. The removal of other words or punctuation without these key words does not change the output, suggesting they are less influential in the model's decision-making process.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact on the change in output, are:

warning, not, buy
