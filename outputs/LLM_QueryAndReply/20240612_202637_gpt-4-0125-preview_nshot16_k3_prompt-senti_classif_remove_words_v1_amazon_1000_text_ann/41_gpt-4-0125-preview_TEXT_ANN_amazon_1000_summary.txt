Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation of the sentence. By examining the dataset, we can identify which removals consistently lead to a change in output.

1. **"what"**: The removal of "what" in several instances leads to a change in output from 0 to -1, indicating its importance in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence.

2. **"calls"**: The word "calls" is part of phrases whose removal changes the output, suggesting its role in the context of the sentence related to phone functionality and user experience.

3. **"lose"**: Similar to "calls", "lose" is also part of phrases that, when removed, change the output. This word contributes to expressing the negative experience of the user.

These words are critical in maintaining the original sentiment of the sentence, and their removal significantly alters the model's output, indicating their importance in the sentence's overall meaning and sentiment.

what, calls, lose
