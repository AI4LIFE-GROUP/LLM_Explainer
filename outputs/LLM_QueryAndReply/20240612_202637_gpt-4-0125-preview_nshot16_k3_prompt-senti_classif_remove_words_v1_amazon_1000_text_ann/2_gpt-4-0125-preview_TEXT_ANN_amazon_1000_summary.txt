Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The dataset shows a pattern where the removal of certain words or combinations of words leads to a change in the model's output, while the removal of others does not. The key to understanding the importance of specific words in determining the model's prediction lies in observing which removals lead to a change in output. 

When the entire phrase "customer service was terrible" is removed, the output changes by -1, indicating a significant shift in the model's interpretation of the sentence. This suggests that the combination of these words is crucial for the model's original output. However, to identify the individual words that hold the most weight, we need to look at instances where removing smaller subsets of words does not change the output, implying those words are less critical on their own or in those specific combinations.

1. **"terrible"** - The removal of "terrible" alone is not explicitly shown, but considering that removing "was terrible" does not change the output, it suggests that "terrible" is a key word. Its presence in the full phrase that, when removed, changes the output, underscores its importance.

2. **"service"** - The removal of "service was" does not change the output, which might imply "service" alone does not shift the model's prediction significantly when removed with "was". However, since "service" is part of the full phrase causing a change in output when removed, it plays a role, albeit less critical than "terrible".

3. **"customer"** - Similar to "service", the removal of "customer" alone or in combinations that do not include "terrible" does not change the output. This suggests "customer" has an impact but is less significant compared to "terrible".

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

terrible, service, customer
