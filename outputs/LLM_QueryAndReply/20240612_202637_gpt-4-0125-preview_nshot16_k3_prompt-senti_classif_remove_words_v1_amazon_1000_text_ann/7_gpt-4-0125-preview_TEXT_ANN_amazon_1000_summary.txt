Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output, especially a negative shift, suggests that the removed words are significant for the model's original prediction. 

Looking at the dataset, the removals that lead to a change in output from 0 to -1 consistently involve the word "what" along with either "big", "waste", or both. This indicates that these words are crucial in determining the model's output. Specifically, any combination that includes "what" and at least one of the other two words ("big" or "waste") results in a negative change in output. 

The word "what" appears in every instance where there's a change in output, highlighting its importance. The words "big" and "waste" also appear frequently in combinations that lead to a change, suggesting their significance but to a slightly lesser extent than "what". 

Therefore, based on the frequency and context of changes in the model's output, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

what, big, waste
