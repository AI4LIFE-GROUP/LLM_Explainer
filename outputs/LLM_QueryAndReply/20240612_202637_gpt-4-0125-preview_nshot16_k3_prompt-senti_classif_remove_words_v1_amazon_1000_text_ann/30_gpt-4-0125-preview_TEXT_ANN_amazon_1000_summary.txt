Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output (from 0 to -1) indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are important for maintaining the original prediction.

1. **"better"** - The removal of "better" in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance. For example, removing "better this third ' ve numerous too" changes the output to -1, and similarly, removing "keep better this is my one ' ve had numerous too )" does not change the output, suggesting that when "better" is removed along with certain other words, it significantly impacts the model's prediction.

2. **"one"** - The removal of "one" alone changes the output to -1, indicating that this word alone has a significant impact on the model's prediction. This suggests that "one" is crucial for the model to maintain its original output.

3. **"numerous"** - The word "numerous" appears in contexts where its removal, along with other words, leads to a change in output (e.g., "better this third ' ve numerous too" and "getting better this third one ' ve had numerous palms too"). This suggests that "numerous" plays a role in the model's prediction, although it might not be as strong as "better" or "one" since its impact is observed more in combination with other words.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

better, one, numerous
