Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe changes in the model's output based on the words removed from the original sentence. The model's output changes to -1 when certain words are removed, indicating a significant shift in meaning or sentiment as interpreted by the model. The words that, when removed, consistently result in a change in output to -1 are "not," "what," and "wanted." This indicates that these words are crucial in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence as interpreted by the model. 

When "not" is removed alone, the output does not change, suggesting that its importance is contextually dependent on the presence of other words. However, combinations including "not" with "what," "wanted," or both lead to a negative change in output, highlighting its contextual importance. The removal of "what" or "wanted" alone does not change the output, but their removal in combination with "not" or as part of the entire phrase "not what i wanted" leads to a change in output. This pattern suggests that these words are key to the sentence's sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model, especially in combination.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, based on their impact when removed, are:

not, what, wanted
