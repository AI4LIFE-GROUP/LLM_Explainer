Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of specific words leads to a change in output. A change in output (from 0 to -1 or vice versa) indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or classification of the sentence. By examining the dataset, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently result in a change in output.

1. **"not"**: The word "not" appears in several instances where its removal leads to a change in output. Its presence or absence can significantly alter the sentiment or meaning of a sentence, indicating its importance in the model's decision-making process.

2. **"expensive"**: This word is directly related to the sentiment of the sentence, especially in the context of cost evaluation. Its removal in several instances leads to a change in output, suggesting its importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence's sentiment.

3. **"better"**: The word "better" is crucial for comparative assessments, especially when evaluating the product against others. Its removal in instances leading to a change in output highlights its role in influencing the model's sentiment analysis.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words appear to be:

not, expensive, better
