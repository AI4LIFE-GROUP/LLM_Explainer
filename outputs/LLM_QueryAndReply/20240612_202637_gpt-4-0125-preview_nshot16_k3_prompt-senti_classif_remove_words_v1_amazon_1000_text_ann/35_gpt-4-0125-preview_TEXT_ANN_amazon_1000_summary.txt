Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe changes in the model's output based on the words removed from the original sentence. The original sentence is "Krussel Always good." When we look at the changes in output, we notice that removing certain words or combinations of words results in a change in output, while removing others does not.

1. **Removing "always" alone or in combination with "good."** does not change the output (change in output: 0). This suggests that "always" and "good" might not be as critical individually or together in influencing the model's prediction.

2. **Removing "krussel" alone or in any combination with "always" and/or "good"** results in a negative change in output (change in output: -1). This indicates a significant impact on the model's output, suggesting that "krussel" is a key word in determining the model's prediction.

3. **The presence or absence of the period (.)** does not affect the model's output when removed, as the change in output remains 0 in those cases. This indicates that punctuation, in this case, the period, does not influence the model's prediction significantly.

Based on these observations, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

krussel, always, good
