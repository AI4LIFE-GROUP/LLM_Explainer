Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a baseline output) to a different value (e.g., from 0 to -1 or vice versa) indicates the removal of those words significantly impacts the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"great"** - This word appears in multiple instances where its removal leads to a change in output or its presence is consistent with no change in output. It's a positive adjective and likely contributes significantly to the sentiment of the sentence.

2. **"expensive"** - The presence or absence of this word in the removed words list correlates with changes in output in several instances. It's a negative adjective and seems to play a crucial role in the model's output.

3. **"performance"** - Similar to "expensive," the word "performance" appears to influence the model's output significantly. It's another positive term, and its removal or inclusion in certain scenarios changes the model's output.

Considering the dataset and the changes in output associated with the removal of specific words, it's reasonable to conclude that these three words have a substantial impact on the model's predictions.

great, expensive, performance
