Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The original sentence is positive in sentiment ("O my gosh the best phone I have ever had."), and the changes in output seem to be from a positive sentiment (0) to a negative sentiment (-1) based on the removal of specific words.

1. **"phone"** - Its removal consistently leads to a change in output to -1 in multiple instances (e.g., "o my gosh the best i have ever had", "o my gosh the phone have ever had", "o my gosh the phone i have ever had"). This indicates that "phone" is crucial for maintaining the positive sentiment of the original sentence.

2. **"best"** - The removal of "best" in combinations that lead to a negative output (e.g., "o my gosh the best i have ever had", "o my gosh the best ever") suggests that this word significantly contributes to the positive sentiment of the model's output.

3. **"i"** - The word "i" appears in several removals that result in a negative change (e.g., "o my gosh the best i have ever had", "o my gosh the phone i have ever had"). Its presence in contexts that change the sentiment to negative when removed suggests it plays a role in the positive sentiment, albeit less critical than "phone" or "best".

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

phone, best, i
