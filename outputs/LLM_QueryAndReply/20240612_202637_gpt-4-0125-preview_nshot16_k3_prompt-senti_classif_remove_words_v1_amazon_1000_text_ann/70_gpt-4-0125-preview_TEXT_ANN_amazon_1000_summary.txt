Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output indicates the importance of the removed words in the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"design"** - Removing this word alone resulted in a change in output (-1), indicating its significant influence on the model's prediction. This is further supported by instances where its removal, along with other words, also led to a change in output.

2. **"is"** - The removal of "is" in various combinations does not consistently result in a change in output. However, its presence in combinations that do change the output suggests it has some influence, albeit less than "design".

3. **"very"** - The word "very" appears in several combinations of removed words that lead to a change in output. However, its influence seems to be less direct compared to "design" and "is", as its removal alone or in certain combinations does not always result in a change.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

design, is, very
