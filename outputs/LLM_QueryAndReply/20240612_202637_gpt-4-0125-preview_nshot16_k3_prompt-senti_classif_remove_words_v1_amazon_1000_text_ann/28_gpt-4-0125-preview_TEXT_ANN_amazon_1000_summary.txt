Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe changes in the model's output based on the words removed from the original sentence. The original sentence is negative, indicated by "Would not recommend." When we look at the changes in output, a change of "-1" signifies a shift towards a more negative sentiment or a decrease in positivity, depending on the model's scale.

1. **"not"**: Removing "not" alone does not change the output (change in output: 0), indicating that its presence or absence without the context of "recommend" does not influence the model's prediction significantly. However, when "not recommend" is removed together, the change in output is consistently "-1", showing a significant impact when these words are considered together.

2. **"recommend"**: The word "recommend" seems crucial because whenever it is removed with "not" (as in "not recommend"), there is a negative change in output. This suggests that "recommend" is a key part of the sentiment being analyzed, especially in its negated form.

3. **"would"**: The removal of "would" in various combinations ("would not", "would recommend", "would .") does not change the output, indicating that "would" by itself or in those combinations is not as critical in altering the model's prediction.

Given these observations, the most important words for the model's prediction, based on their impact when removed, appear to be in the following order:

not, recommend, would
