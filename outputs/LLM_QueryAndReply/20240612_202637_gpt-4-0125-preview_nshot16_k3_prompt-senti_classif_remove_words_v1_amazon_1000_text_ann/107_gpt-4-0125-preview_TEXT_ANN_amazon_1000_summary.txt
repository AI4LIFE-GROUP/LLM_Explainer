Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence to a different value (e.g., from 1 to 0 or vice versa) indicates the removed words had a significant impact on the model's decision-making process. Conversely, if the output remains the same despite the removal of certain words, those words can be considered less critical for the model's prediction.

Looking at the dataset:

1. When "use this case" is removed, the change in output is 0, suggesting these words are not crucial for the model's prediction.
2. Removal of punctuation like "." alone also results in no change in output, indicating punctuation is not a key factor.
3. The removal of "can" alone leads to no change in output, suggesting it's not critical by itself.
4. However, when words related to the subject ("i"), the ability or permission ("can", "t"), and the reason for inability to use ("because", "smell", "disgusting") are removed, we see changes in the output, indicating their importance. Specifically, sentences that maintain the structure of a reason ("because") and the negative aspects ("smell", "disgusting") tend to revert the output to 1, highlighting their significance.

Given these observations, the words that are most consistently associated with changes in the model's output, and thus can be inferred as most important for the model's prediction, are related to the core complaint about the case: the reason for dissatisfaction ("because") and the descriptors of the problem ("smell", "disgusting").

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact on the change in output, are:

disgusting, smell, because
