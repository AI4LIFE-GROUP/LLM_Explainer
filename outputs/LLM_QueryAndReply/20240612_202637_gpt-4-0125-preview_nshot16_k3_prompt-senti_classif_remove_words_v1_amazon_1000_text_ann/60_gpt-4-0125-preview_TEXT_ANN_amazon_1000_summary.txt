Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

Looking at the dataset, the removals that lead to a change in output (from 0 to -1) often involve the removal of specific words, suggesting these words are crucial for the model to maintain its original output. 

1. The word "crap" when removed alone does not change the output, indicating it might not be as critical by itself for the negative sentiment or the model's output.
2. The apostrophe (') seems to be involved in several removals that lead to a change in output, but it's more about the combinations of words it's removed with rather than the apostrophe itself being significant.
3. The words "it", "s" (as in 's for is), and "a" appear frequently in combinations that lead to a change in output when removed. However, their importance seems to be contextual rather than standalone.

Given these observations, the most impactful words seem to be those that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output. Specifically, combinations that include "it", "s" (or 's), and "a" alongside other words seem to trigger a change most consistently. 

Therefore, the top three most important words, based on their presence in combinations that lead to a change in output and considering their frequency and impact, would be:

it, s, a
