Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a baseline output) indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or prediction based on the absence of specific words.

1. **"makes"** - The removal of this word appears in several instances where the change in output is -1, suggesting its importance in maintaining the original output or meaning.

2. **"strange"** - This word also appears frequently in removals that lead to a change in output to -1. Its presence or absence seems to significantly affect the model's output, indicating its importance.

3. **"noises"** - Similar to "makes" and "strange," the removal of "noises" is often associated with a change in output to -1. This suggests that the word "noises" plays a crucial role in the model's interpretation of the sentence.

These words, when removed, consistently result in a negative change in the model's output, indicating their significant role in the sentence's meaning as interpreted by the model.
