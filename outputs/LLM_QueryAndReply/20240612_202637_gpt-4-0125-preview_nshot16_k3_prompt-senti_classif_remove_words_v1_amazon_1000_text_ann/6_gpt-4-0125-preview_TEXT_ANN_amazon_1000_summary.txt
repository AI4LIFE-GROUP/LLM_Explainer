Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look for patterns in the dataset where the removal of specific words consistently leads to a change in output. A change in output, in this case, is indicated by a shift from 0 to -1. This suggests that the words removed in those instances are crucial for the model to maintain its original output.

Upon reviewing the dataset, it's evident that the removal of personal pronouns and negations has a significant impact on the model's output. Specifically, the words "I," "didn't," and "think" are frequently involved in scenarios where their removal leads to a change in output. This pattern suggests that these words play a critical role in the model's interpretation of the sentence, likely because they are key to expressing the subjectivity and negation in the original sentence.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their apparent influence on the change in output, are:

I, didn't, think
