Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"difficult"** - Its removal in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., from 0 to -1), indicating that it's crucial for the model to interpret the sentence negatively.

2. **"recommend"** - The removal of this word in various combinations also leads to changes in output. This suggests that "recommend" plays a significant role in how the model perceives the advice or suggestion aspect of the sentence.

3. **"avoiding"** - Similar to "recommend," the removal of "avoiding" in different contexts changes the output, indicating its importance in contributing to the negative sentiment of the model's interpretation.

Therefore, the top three most important words appear to be:

difficult, recommend, avoiding
