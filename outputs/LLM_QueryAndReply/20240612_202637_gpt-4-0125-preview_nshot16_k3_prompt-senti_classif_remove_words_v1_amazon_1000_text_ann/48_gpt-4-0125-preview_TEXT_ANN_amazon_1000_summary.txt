Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for maintaining the original meaning or sentiment of the sentence.

From the dataset, we observe that removing "gotten," "a," "on it," and "compliments" individually or in various combinations does not consistently lead to a change in output. However, any removal that includes "have," "lot," and "of" in various combinations consistently results in a change in output to -1. This suggests that these words play a significant role in the model's interpretation of the sentence.

It's important to note that the removal of "have" in combination with other key words like "gotten," "lot," "of," and "compliments" leads to a negative change in output, indicating its importance. Similarly, "lot" and "of" appear in combinations that significantly alter the model's output, highlighting their importance in the context of this sentence.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

have, lot, of
