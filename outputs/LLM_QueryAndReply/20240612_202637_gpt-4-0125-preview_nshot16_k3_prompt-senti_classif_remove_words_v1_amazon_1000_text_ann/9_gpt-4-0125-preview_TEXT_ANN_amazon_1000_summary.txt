Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output (from 0 to -1) indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are important for maintaining the original meaning or sentiment of the sentence.

1. **"so"** - Removing "so" alone or in combination with other words often results in a change in output (-1), indicating its importance in the sentence structure or conveying the context.

2. **"will"** - The removal of "will" in different combinations also leads to a change in output. This suggests that "will" plays a crucial role in the sentence, likely because it affects the tense or the certainty of the action described.

3. **"conversation"** - The word "conversation" appears in several removals that change the output. Its removal, especially in combinations that significantly alter the sentence's meaning, indicates its importance in the context of the sentence.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

so, will, conversation
