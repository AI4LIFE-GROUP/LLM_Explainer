Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the model's output changes based on the presence or absence of specific words in the sentence. The output seems to be sensitive to the removal of certain words, indicating their importance in the model's decision-making process. By comparing instances where the change in output is 1 to those where it is 0, we can infer which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output.

1. **"exceptional"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output, suggesting its significant role in the model's evaluation of the sentence. Its presence likely contributes positively to the model's perception of the product's quality.

2. **"official"** - This word's removal also results in a change in output in multiple cases. It seems to add value to the product being described, possibly indicating authenticity or endorsement that the model finds relevant.

3. **"quality"** - Similar to "exceptional" and "official," the removal of "quality" impacts the model's output. This suggests that the model views the term as a key descriptor of the product, influencing its overall assessment.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

exceptional, official, quality
