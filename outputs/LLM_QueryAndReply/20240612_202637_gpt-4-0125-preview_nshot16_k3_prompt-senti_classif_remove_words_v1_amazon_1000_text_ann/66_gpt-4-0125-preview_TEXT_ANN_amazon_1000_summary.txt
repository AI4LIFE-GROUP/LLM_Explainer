Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or prediction. 

1. **"didn't" or "didn ' t"**: Every time the contraction for "did not" is removed, either in its contracted form or with spaces ("didn ' t"), there is a change in output to -1. This suggests that the negation is crucial for the model's understanding or prediction of the sentence.

2. **"work"**: The word "work" appears in all instances where its removal (along with other words) leads to a change in output. This suggests that "work" is a key component of the sentence's meaning as perceived by the model.

3. **"either"**: The word "either" is also consistently present in removals that lead to a change in output. Its presence in combinations where the output changes suggests it plays a role in the model's interpretation, though it's not as pivotal as "didn't" or "work" since its removal alone or in less significant combinations does not always alter the output.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

didn't, work, either
