Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words are significant for the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"best"** - Removing "best" alone changes the output to 0, indicating its importance. When it's removed as part of larger groups of words, the output often changes, suggesting its presence or absence significantly influences the model's output.

2. **"bluetooth"** - The word "bluetooth" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output. Its removal, especially when combined with "best," tends to flip the output to 1, indicating its critical role in the model's prediction.

3. **"on"** - The word "on" is part of removals that lead to no change when removed with less significant words (e.g., "the"), but when removed with more critical words, it doesn't prevent the output from changing. This suggests it has a lesser influence than "best" or "bluetooth" but still plays a role in the model's decision-making process.

Given this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

best, bluetooth, on
