Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the dataset by looking at the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words have a significant impact on the model's decision-making process.

1. **"working" and "great"** - Whenever both "working" and "great" are removed together, regardless of whether "has" is also removed, the change in output is consistently 0. This indicates that the presence of both "working" and "great" is crucial for maintaining the original output. Their removal leads to a change, suggesting high importance.

2. **"has"** - The removal of "has," especially when combined with other words (like "working" or "great"), sometimes leads to a change in output and sometimes does not. However, its removal alone does not seem to be tested directly, making it slightly harder to gauge its individual impact compared to "working" and "great." Yet, its frequent appearance in scenarios where the output changes when removed alongside other words suggests it does play a role, albeit less critical than "working" and "great."

Given this analysis, "working" and "great" appear to be the most critical words for the model's prediction, with "has" being important but to a lesser extent.

working, great, has
