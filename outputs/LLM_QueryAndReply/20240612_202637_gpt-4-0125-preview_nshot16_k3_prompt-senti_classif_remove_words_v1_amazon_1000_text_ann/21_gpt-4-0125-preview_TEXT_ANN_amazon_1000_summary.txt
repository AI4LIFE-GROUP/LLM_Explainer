Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is directly influenced by the presence or absence of specific words in the original sentence. A change in output of "-1" indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction when certain words are removed, while a change of "0" suggests no significant impact from the removal of those words.

From the dataset, it's clear that the removal of the entire sentence or large chunks of it consistently results in a change in output to "-1". However, to identify the top three most important words, we need to focus on smaller, more specific removals that lead to a change in output. 

1. **Verizon**: The removal of "Verizon" or its variations (with or without apostrophes and additional letters) often leads to a change in output to "-1". This suggests that the subject of the sentence is crucial for the model's prediction.

2. **Bills**: Similar to "Verizon", the removal of "bills" or its variations significantly affects the model's output. This indicates that the topic of the sentence is also vital for the prediction.

3. **Pricing Plans**: Although not a single word, the phrase "pricing plans" is consistently involved in changes that affect the model's output. Its removal or the removal of parts of it tends to result in a significant change, indicating its importance in the context of the sentence.

Given the analysis, the top three most important words/phrases, considering "pricing plans" as a single entity due to its repeated impact when altered, are:

Verizon, bills, pricing plans
