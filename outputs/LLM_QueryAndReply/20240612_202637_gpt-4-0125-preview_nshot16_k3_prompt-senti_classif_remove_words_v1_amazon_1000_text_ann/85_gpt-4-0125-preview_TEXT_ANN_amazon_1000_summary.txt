Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's decision-making process. 

1. **Complaint**: The removal of "complaint" in several instances leads to a change in output (-1), indicating its importance in the original sentence's sentiment or meaning. This word directly relates to the subject matter of the sentence, highlighting a negative aspect.

2. **Battery**: Although not as directly impactful as "complaint" when removed alone, "battery" is part of the context that changes the output when removed with certain other words. It's central to the specific issue being discussed, which is a negative aspect affecting the sentiment.

3. **Biggest**: The word "biggest" modifies the severity or importance of the complaint. Its removal in various combinations affects the output, suggesting that it plays a role in emphasizing the scale of the issue, thereby influencing the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment.

Given these observations, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact when removed, are:

complaint, battery, biggest
