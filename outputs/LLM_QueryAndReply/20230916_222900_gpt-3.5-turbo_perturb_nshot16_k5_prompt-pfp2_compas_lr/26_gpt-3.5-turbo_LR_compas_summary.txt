For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'F':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'F' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'F' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where A has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.012, B: 0.337, C: 0.224, D: 0.118, E: -0.112, F: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.116, B: -0.209, C: -0.324, D: 0.170, E: -0.069, F: 0.076 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.177, B: -0.258, C: -0.133, D: 0.043, E: -0.119, F: 0.169 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.156, B: -0.207, C: -0.161, D: -0.076, E: 0.009, F: 0.028 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.210, B: -0.179, C: -0.147, D: -0.024, E: -0.078, F: -0.106 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.208, B: -0.277, C: 0.009, D: 0.188, E: 0.002, F: -0.174 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.335, B: -0.238, C: -0.032, D: 0.011, E: 0.063, F: -0.116 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.183, B: 0.222, C: 0.240, D: 0.140, E: -0.040, F: -0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.089, B: -0.281, C: -0.141, D: -0.041, E: -0.046, F: -0.068 

b. Instances where A has negative changes:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.200, B: 0.228, C: 0.067, D: 0.142, E: -0.062, F: 0.085 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.135, B: 0.334, C: 0.081, D: -0.106, E: -0.045, F: -0.019 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.210, B: 0.225, C: 0.131, D: 0.007, E: -0.137, F: 0.070 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.307, B: 0.118, C: 0.114, D: 0.036, E: -0.163, F: 0.024 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.147, B: 0.272, C: 0.073, D: -0.062, E: -0.032, F: 0.161 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.215, B: 0.156, C: 0.227, D: -0.040, E: 0.048, F: -0.055 

From the instances analyzed, it seems that positive changes in feature A are more likely to result in a change in output compared to negative changes. This suggests that an increase in feature A tends to have a positive correlation with the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, let's rate the importance of feature A on a scale of 0-100. Since we need to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a rating of 50 to feature A.

2. Rank: A

Moving on to the next feature:

1. Feature B:
a. Instances where B has positive changes:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.012, B: 0.337, C: 0.224, D: 0.118, E: -0.112, F: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.135, B: 0.334, C: 0.081, D: -0.106, E: -0.045, F: -0.019 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.210, B: 0.225, C: 0.131, D: 0.007, E: -0.137, F: 0.070 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.147, B: 0.272, C: 0.073, D: -0.062, E: -0.032, F: 0.161 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.215, B: 0.156, C: 0.227, D: -0.040, E: 0.048, F: -0.055 

b. Instances where B has negative changes:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.116, B: -0.209, C: -0.324, D: 0.170, E: -0.069, F: 0.076 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.177, B: -0.258, C: -0.133, D: 0.043, E: -0.119, F: 0.169 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.156, B: -0.207, C: -0.161, D: -0.076, E: 0.009, F: 0.028 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.210, B: -0.179, C: -0.147, D: -0.024, E: -0.078, F: -0.106 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.208, B: -0.277, C: 0.009, D: 0.188, E: 0.002, F: -0.174 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.335, B: -0.238, C: -0.032, D: 0.011, E: 0.063, F: -0.116 

From the instances analyzed, it appears that both positive and negative changes in feature B have a similar likelihood of resulting in a change in output. This suggests that feature B may not have a strong correlation with the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, let's rate the importance of feature B on a scale of 0-100. Since the correlation is not strong, we can assign a rating of 40 to feature B.

2. Rank: BA

Moving on to the next feature:

1. Feature C:
a. Instances where C has positive changes:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.012, B: 0.337, C: 0.224, D: 0.118, E: -0.112, F: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.200, B: 0.228, C: 0.067, D: 0.142, E: -0.062, F: 0.085 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.135, B: 0.334, C: 0.081, D: -0.106, E: -0.045, F: -0.019

   - Change in Input: A: -0.183, B: 0.222, C: 0.240, D: 0.140, E: -0.040, F: -0.061

   - Change in Input: A: 0.116, B: -0.209, C: -0.324, D: 0.170, E: -0.069, F: 0.076 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.177, B: -0.258, C: -0.133, D: 0.043, E: -0.119, F: 0.169 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.156, B: -0.207, C: -0.161, D: -0.076, E: 0.009, F: 0.028 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.210, B: -0.179, C: -0.147, D: -0.024, E: -0.078, F: -0.106 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.208, B: -0.277, C: 0.009, D: 0.188, E: 0.002, F: -0.174

   - Change in Input: A: -0.215, B: 0.156, C: 0.227, D: -0.040, E: 0.048, F: -0.055 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.183, B: 0.222, C: 0.240, D: 0.140, E: -0.040, F: -0.061 

From the instances analyzed, it seems that both positive and negative changes in feature C have a similar likelihood of resulting in a change in output. This suggests that feature C may not have a strong correlation with the output.

Considering both positive and negative correlations, let's rate the importance of feature C on a scale of 0-100. Since the correlation is not strong, we can assign a rating of 40 to feature C.
