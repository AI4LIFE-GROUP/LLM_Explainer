Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the patterns of word removals and the corresponding changes in output. The model's output changes between 1 and 0 based on the presence or absence of specific words in the modified sentences. By examining which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, we can infer their importance to the model's decision-making process.

1. **"recommend"**: The presence or absence of "recommend" seems to significantly influence the model's output. In cases where "recommend" is removed, there's a notable shift in the output, indicating its importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

2. **"waiting"**: Similar to "recommend," "waiting" appears to play a crucial role. Its removal in various contexts leads to changes in the model's output, suggesting that it is a key word in determining the sentiment or decision the model is trying to predict.

3. **"future"**: The word "future" also seems to be critical. Its removal, especially in contexts where other key words like "recommend" and "waiting" are also removed, affects the output, indicating its significance in the overall interpretation by the model.

These words are closely tied to the sentiment and advice given in the original sentence, which likely explains their importance in the model's predictions.

recommend, waiting, future
