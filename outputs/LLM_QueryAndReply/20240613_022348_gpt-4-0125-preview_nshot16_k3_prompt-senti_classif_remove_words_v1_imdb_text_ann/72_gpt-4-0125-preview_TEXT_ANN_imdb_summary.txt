Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests a significant impact by the removed words on the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"i"**: The word "i" appears in multiple removals that lead to a change in output (e.g., "i saw film i it .", "i just saw this film and i recommend .", "i saw film and i recommend it ."), indicating its importance. However, its removal alone ("i i") does not change the output, suggesting its importance is contextual rather than absolute.

2. **"recommend"**: The word "recommend" is crucial because its removal in certain contexts leads to a change in output (e.g., "just film and i recommend .", "i this film and recommend it"), indicating its strong influence on the model's positive prediction about the film.

3. **"saw"**: The word "saw" appears in several contexts where its removal leads to a change in output (e.g., "just saw", "i just saw film and recommend it ."), suggesting its role in the model's understanding of the sentence, likely contributing to the narrative of having watched the film.

Given the dataset, it's clear that the presence or absence of these words significantly influences the model's output, indicating their importance in the model's decision-making process. Therefore, the top three most important words, based on their impact on the model's predictions, are:

i, recommend, saw
