Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"simply"** - Removing "simply" alone changes the output to 1, indicating a significant impact. Additionally, its removal in combinations that lead to a change in output underscores its importance.

2. **"incredible"** - The word "incredible" also plays a crucial role. Its removal, both individually and in combination with "simply," leads to a change in output, highlighting its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis.

3. **"everything"** - The removal of "everything" in various combinations, especially when it leads to a change in output to 0 or 1, suggests it has a considerable impact on the model's interpretation. Its presence or absence in combinations that alter the model's output indicates its importance.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction are:

simply, incredible, everything
