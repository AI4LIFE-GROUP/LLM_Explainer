Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or classification of the sentence.

1. **"wonderful"** - The removal of "wonderful" in various combinations ("a wonderful", "wonderful story", "looked like wonderful", "like wonderful") consistently leads to a change in output. This indicates that "wonderful" is a key word that the model relies on to make its prediction.

2. **"story"** - The word "story" also plays a significant role. When "story" is removed alone or as part of "wonderful story", there's a change in output, suggesting its importance in the model's decision-making process.

3. **"looked"** - The word "looked" seems to be important as well. Its removal, especially in combinations without "wonderful" (e.g., "it looked like a", "looked like a wonderful"), affects the output, indicating its significance in the model's prediction.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on the given dataset, are:

wonderful, story, looked
