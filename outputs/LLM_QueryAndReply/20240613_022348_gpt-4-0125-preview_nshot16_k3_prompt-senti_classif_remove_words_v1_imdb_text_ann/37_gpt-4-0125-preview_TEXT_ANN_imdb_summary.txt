Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output in relation to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a baseline output) indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's prediction. 

1. **"know"** - Removing "know" in some instances leads to a change in output (-1), suggesting its importance in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence. Specifically, its removal in combinations where other significant words are present (like "day" or alone) still results in a change.

2. **"genius"** - The word "genius" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output. Its presence or absence seems to significantly affect the model's interpretation, indicating its importance.

3. **"passion"** - Similar to "genius," "passion" is a key term whose removal in various contexts leads to a change in output. It's especially notable that its removal, even when other critical words are left in or out, affects the model's output.

These words, based on the dataset, seem to carry significant weight in the model's prediction process, indicating their importance in the original sentence's sentiment or meaning.

know, genius, passion
