Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. The original sentence is "A film not easily forgotten." The changes in output are particularly telling when the removal of certain words results in a change in the model's output.

1. **"not"** - The removal of "not" alone and in combinations where its absence directly leads to a change in output (e.g., from "A film not easily forgotten." to "A film easily forgotten.") suggests that "not" plays a crucial role in flipping the sentiment or meaning of the sentence. The output changes from 0 to -1 in scenarios where "not" is removed, indicating a significant impact on the model's interpretation.

2. **"forgotten"** - The word "forgotten" also appears to be crucial. When it is removed, the output changes, indicating its importance in the sentiment or meaning of the original sentence. The presence or absence of "forgotten" directly influences the model's output, suggesting it carries significant weight in the model's evaluation.

3. **"easily"** - While "easily" might not seem as impactful as "not" or "forgotten" at first glance, its removal in combination with other words (without significantly changing the output when removed with "not") suggests it plays a role in the nuance of the sentence's sentiment but is less critical than "not" and "forgotten". Its removal alone does not change the output, indicating it is of lesser importance than "not" and "forgotten".

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

not, forgotten, easily
