Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the dataset by looking at which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output. A change in output from 1 to 0 or vice versa indicates a significant impact on the model's decision-making process by the absence of these words.

1. **"yet"** - The removal of "yet" leads to a change in output in several instances. When removed alone or with other words, its absence often flips the output, indicating its high importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

2. **"watching"** - The word "watching" also appears to play a crucial role. Its removal in different combinations leads to a change in the model's output, suggesting that it significantly contributes to the model's understanding or interpretation of the sentence.

3. **"i"** - The pronoun "i" seems to be less impactful than "yet" and "watching" but still important. Its removal, especially in combinations without "yet" or "watching," affects the output, indicating its role in the sentence's overall meaning as perceived by the model.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

yet, watching, i
