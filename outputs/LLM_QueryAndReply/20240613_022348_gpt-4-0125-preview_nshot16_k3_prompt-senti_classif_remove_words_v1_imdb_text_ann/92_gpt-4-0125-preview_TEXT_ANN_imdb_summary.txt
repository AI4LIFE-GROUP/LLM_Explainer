Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe that the model's output changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The change in output is indicated by a shift from 0 to -1, suggesting a negative impact on the model's perception of the sentence. 

The words "bad," "characters," and "story" appear to be pivotal. Whenever combinations including these words are removed, there's a consistent change in output to -1, indicating their significant negative influence on the model's output. Specifically, the removal of "bad" in various contexts alongside "characters" and "story" leads to a notable change, highlighting their importance in the model's evaluation process. 

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact when removed, are:

bad, characters, story
