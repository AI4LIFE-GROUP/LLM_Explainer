Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is directly influenced by the removal of specific words. The model's output changes from 0 to -1 when certain words are removed, indicating a shift in the sentiment or meaning captured by the model. By examining the instances where the change in output occurs, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently result in a change in output.

1. **"too"** - The removal of "too" in several instances does not always change the output (e.g., "Removed words: too predictable flick" results in a change of 0), but its presence in combinations that lead to a change in output (-1) suggests its importance in the overall sentiment of the sentence.

2. **"even"** - The word "even" appears in multiple instances where its removal leads to a change in output to -1. This suggests that "even" plays a significant role in the context or intensity of the sentence, affecting the model's interpretation.

3. **"flick"** - While "flick" does not seem as crucial as "too" or "even" at first glance, its removal in certain combinations leads to a change in output. However, its impact appears to be less direct compared to "too" and "even," suggesting it's of lesser importance but still relevant.

Given the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, based on their impact on the change in output, are:

too, even, flick
