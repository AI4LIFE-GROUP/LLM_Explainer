Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation or prediction of the sentence. Conversely, if the removal of certain words does not change the output (remaining 0), those words are less critical in influencing the model's prediction.

From the dataset, we observe that the removal of certain combinations of words consistently results in a change in output from 0 to -1. Specifically, any removal that includes the combination of "what," "the," and variations that include "kind," "is," and "that" without the expletive or "crap" tends to result in a negative change in output. However, the presence of "hell," "crap," and the question mark does not consistently influence the change in output when removed, as their removal can result in either no change or a change depending on the combination of other words removed with them.

Given this analysis, the words that appear most frequently in combinations that change the output to -1, and are thus most likely to be important in determining the model's prediction, are:

1. "what" - Its removal is a common factor in scenarios where the output changes to -1.
2. "the" - Similarly, its removal often results in a negative change, indicating its importance.
3. "kind" or "is" - Both appear frequently in combinations that result in a change to -1, but given the constraints, we must choose one. "is" seems slightly more integral as it is a fundamental verb that contributes to the sentence structure, whereas "kind" could be seen as more interchangeable.

Therefore, the top three most important words, based on their impact on the model's output, are:

what, the, is
