Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of specific words or phrases resulted in a change in output. A change in output, in this context, indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. By comparing the sentences with a change in output (-1) to those without a change (0), we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's prediction.

Looking at the dataset, the words "unfortunately," "virtue," and "regrettable" stand out. Each time these words are removed, there is often a change in output, indicating their importance in the model's analysis. Specifically:

1. "Unfortunately" is removed in several instances that lead to a change in output, suggesting its role in setting the overall negative tone of the sentence.
2. "Virtue" is also removed in instances leading to a change, indicating its importance in conveying positive aspects that are contrasted with the negative aspects highlighted by other words.
3. "Regrettable" is crucial as well, as its removal in certain contexts leads to a change in output, highlighting its role in expressing negativity towards the script.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

unfortunately, virtue, regrettable
