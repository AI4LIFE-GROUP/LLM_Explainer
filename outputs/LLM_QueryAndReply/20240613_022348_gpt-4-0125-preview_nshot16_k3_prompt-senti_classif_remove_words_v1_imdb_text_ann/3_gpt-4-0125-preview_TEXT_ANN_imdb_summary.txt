Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is closely tied to the presence or absence of certain words in the modified sentences. The model's output changes to -1 when specific words are removed, indicating these words have a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"bad"**: The word "bad" appears in almost all instances where its removal leads to a change in output to -1. This suggests that "bad" is crucial for the model to interpret the sentence negatively.

2. **"plot"**: The word "plot" also seems to play a significant role. Its removal in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in the model's understanding of the sentence.

3. **"idea"**: Similar to "plot", the removal of "idea" in certain contexts leads to a change in output to -1, suggesting that it is also a key word for the model's interpretation.

Given this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction appear to be:

bad, plot, idea
