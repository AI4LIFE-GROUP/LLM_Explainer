Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of specific words leads to a change in output. A change in output, in this context, indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. By examining the dataset, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently result in a change in output.

1. **"realistic"**: The removal of "realistic" in several instances leads to a change in output, suggesting its importance in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence. It appears in contexts where its removal significantly alters the model's interpretation.

2. **"never"**: The word "never" also plays a crucial role. Its removal in different contexts leads to a change in output, indicating its strong influence on the sentiment or meaning conveyed by the model. It is pivotal in expressing the negation that significantly alters the sentence's sentiment.

3. **"pathetic"**: This word, when removed, affects the output in certain instances, pointing to its importance in contributing to the overall sentiment of the sentence. It is a key adjective that strongly colors the sentiment of the statement.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

realistic, never, pathetic
