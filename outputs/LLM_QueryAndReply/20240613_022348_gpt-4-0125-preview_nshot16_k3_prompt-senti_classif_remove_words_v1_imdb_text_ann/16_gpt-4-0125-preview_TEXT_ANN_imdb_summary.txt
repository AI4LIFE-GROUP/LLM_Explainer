Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is influenced by the presence or absence of specific words. When words are removed and the output changes (from 0 to -1), it indicates those words are crucial for the model's original understanding or interpretation of the sentence. Conversely, when words are removed and the output remains the same (0), it suggests those words are not as critical for the model's interpretation.

Looking at the dataset, the removals that lead to a change in output (-1) often involve key descriptive terms and connectors that significantly alter the sentence's meaning. Specifically, the words "incomprehensible," "relation," and "primary" appear frequently in removals that result in a change in output. These words are crucial for understanding the complexity and connection between the secondary and primary plot lines mentioned in the original sentence. Their removal likely disrupts the model's ability to comprehend the critique of the plot's coherence and its interconnectedness, leading to a significant change in the model's output.

Therefore, based on the dataset and the analysis:

incomprehensible, relation, primary
