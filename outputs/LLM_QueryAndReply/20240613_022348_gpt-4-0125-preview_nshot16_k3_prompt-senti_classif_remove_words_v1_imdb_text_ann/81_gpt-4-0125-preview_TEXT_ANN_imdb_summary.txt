Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"insult"** - When "insult" is removed, the change in output indicates a significant shift, suggesting that it's a key word for the negative sentiment of the sentence. Its presence or absence directly influences the model's output.

2. **"film"** - The word "film" appears in several instances where its removal leads to a change in output. Given that it's part of the subject of the sentence, its importance in the model's analysis is highlighted by how its removal affects the prediction.

3. **"public"** - The word "public" is also crucial. Its removal in certain contexts changes the output, indicating its role in the overall sentiment or context understanding by the model. It seems to contribute significantly to the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment towards the audience.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

insult, film, public
