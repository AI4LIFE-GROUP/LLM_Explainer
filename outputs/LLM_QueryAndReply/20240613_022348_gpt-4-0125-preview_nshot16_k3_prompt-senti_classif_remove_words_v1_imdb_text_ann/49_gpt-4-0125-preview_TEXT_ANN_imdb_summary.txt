Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for maintaining the original meaning or sentiment.

Looking at the dataset, the changes in output to -1 occur when certain words are removed, indicating their importance. We notice that removing words related to the existence of the plot ("there is no plot"), the action of keeping ("to keep"), and the direction or continuation ("going") frequently leads to a change in output to -1. These changes suggest that these words are critical for the model's understanding of the sentence.

However, to rank the top three, we need to identify which of these removals consistently result in a significant change in the model's output. The words "to keep" and "going" appear in several instances where their removal leads to a negative change in output, indicating their high importance. The phrase "there is no plot" is also crucial, but it's a combination of words rather than a single word. Focusing on individual words, "plot" stands out as it is central to the theme of the sentence.

Therefore, the top three most important words based on their impact on the model's output change, ranked from most important to least important, are:

going, to keep, plot
