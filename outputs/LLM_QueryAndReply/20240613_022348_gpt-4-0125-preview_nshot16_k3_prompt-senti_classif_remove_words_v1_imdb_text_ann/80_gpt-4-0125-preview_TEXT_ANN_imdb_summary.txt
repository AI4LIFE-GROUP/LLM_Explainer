Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is closely tied to the presence or absence of specific words in the removed words list. When the output changes from the original, it indicates that the removed words had a significant impact on the model's prediction. By examining the instances where the change in output is -1, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output.

1. The word "***spoilers***" appears frequently in the removals that lead to a change in output. This suggests it has a significant impact on the model's prediction, likely because it serves as a contextual cue.

2. The word "crafted" is also present in several instances that result in a change in output. Its removal seems to affect the model's interpretation of the sentence's quality or craftsmanship, indicating its importance.

3. The word "superbly" appears in multiple removals associated with a change in output. This suggests that it plays a crucial role in the model's assessment of the sentence, likely contributing to the positive sentiment or high quality indicated by the original sentence.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

***spoilers***, crafted, superbly
