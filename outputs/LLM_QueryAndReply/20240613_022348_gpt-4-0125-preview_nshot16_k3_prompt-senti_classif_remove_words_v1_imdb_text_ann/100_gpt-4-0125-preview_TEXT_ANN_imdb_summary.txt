REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests a significant impact by the removed words on the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"loved"** - This word's removal consistently leads to a change in output (e.g., from 1 to 0 or vice versa), indicating its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis. Its presence or absence directly affects the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment.

2. **"scary"** - Similar to "loved," the removal of "scary" also results in a change in output in several instances. This suggests that "scary" is crucial for the model to understand the context or sentiment of the sentence, likely contributing to the overall negative or positive sentiment.

3. **"really"** - The word "really" seems to play a significant role as well, as its removal in certain combinations leads to a change in output. This indicates that "really" may serve to intensify the sentiment expressed in the sentence, affecting the model's perception of the sentiment's strength.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

loved, scary, really
