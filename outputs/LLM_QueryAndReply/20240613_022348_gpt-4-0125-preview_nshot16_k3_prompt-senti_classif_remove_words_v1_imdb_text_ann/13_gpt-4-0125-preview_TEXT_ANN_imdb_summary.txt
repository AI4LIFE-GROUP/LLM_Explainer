Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation of the sentence. By comparing the instances where the change in output occurs (-1) with those where it does not (0), we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output.

1. **"not"**: The removal of "not" in several instances leads to a change in output to -1, indicating its importance in the sentence's sentiment or meaning. This word is crucial for negation, altering the sentence's sentiment significantly.

2. **"talent"**: The word "talent" appears in several removals that result in a change of output to -1. Its presence or absence seems to significantly affect the model's interpretation, likely because it's a key subject of the sentence.

3. **"pathetic"**: Similar to "talent", "pathetic" is involved in changes that lead to -1. This adjective strongly influences the sentence's tone, contributing to a negative sentiment when present.

These words are critical in determining the sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model, as their removal leads to a notable change in output, indicating their significant influence on the model's predictions.

not, talent, pathetic
