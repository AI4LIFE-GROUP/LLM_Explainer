Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The original sentence has a negative sentiment towards the movie. When words are removed and the change in output is -1, it indicates those words are crucial for maintaining the original sentiment of the sentence. Conversely, when the change in output is 0, the removed words are less critical for the sentiment conveyed by the model.

1. **"agree"** - Removing "agree" in several instances leads to a change in output to -1, indicating its importance in maintaining the original sentiment of agreement with a negative opinion about the movie.

2. **"bad"** - The word "bad" directly relates to the negative sentiment of the sentence. Its removal in multiple instances also leads to a change in output to -1, showing its significance in expressing the negative sentiment.

3. **"movie"** - The context of the sentiment is about a movie. When "movie" is removed, especially in combinations where the output changes to -1, it suggests that the word is crucial for the model to understand the subject of the sentiment.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction are:

agree, bad, movie
