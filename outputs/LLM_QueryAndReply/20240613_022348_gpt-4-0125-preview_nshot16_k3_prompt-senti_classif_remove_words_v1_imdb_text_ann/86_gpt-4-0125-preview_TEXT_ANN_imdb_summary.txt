Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"worst"** - When "worst" is removed, the change in output is 0, indicating that its presence or absence directly influences the model's output. This suggests that "worst" is a key word for the model's negative sentiment analysis.

2. **"sappiest"** - The removal of "sappiest" along with other words in various combinations leads to changes in output. However, its specific removal alongside "worst" in different instances shows varied impacts, suggesting it's important but not as singularly decisive as "worst".

3. **"dialogue"** - The word "dialogue" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output. Its presence or absence in combinations seems to affect the model's output, indicating its importance in the context of the sentence.

Based on the dataset and the changes in output associated with the removal of specific words, it appears that the model's prediction is most significantly influenced by the presence of negative sentiment words and key subject identifiers.

worst, sappiest, dialogue
