Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"waste"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., from 1 to 0 or vice versa), indicating its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis. It's a key descriptor that likely shifts the sentence from negative to neutral or positive when removed.

2. **"whine" and "cry"** - These words, often removed together, seem to play a crucial role in the model's output. Their presence or absence significantly alters the model's perception, likely contributing to the sentiment analysis by emphasizing the negative aspects of the behavior described.

3. **"pretty"** - This word's removal in certain contexts also leads to a change in output. It may contribute to the model's understanding of the context or the subjects being described, affecting the overall sentiment or focus of the sentence.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

waste, whine, pretty
