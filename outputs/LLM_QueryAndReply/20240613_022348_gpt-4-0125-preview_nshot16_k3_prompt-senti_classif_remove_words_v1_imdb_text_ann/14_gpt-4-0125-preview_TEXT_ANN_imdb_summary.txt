Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

Looking at the dataset, the changes in output occur when certain words are removed, indicating their importance. The words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output (from 0 to -1) are key to understanding the model's behavior. 

1. **Originality**: The removal of "originality" in several instances leads to a change in output, suggesting its importance in the model's assessment of the sentence.
2. **Freshness**: Similarly, "freshness" is another word whose removal often results in a change in output, indicating its significant role in the model's evaluation.
3. **Offer**: The word "offer" also appears to be crucial; its removal in specific contexts changes the output, highlighting its impact on the model's interpretation.

These words are directly related to the critical elements of the original sentence's sentiment and content, affecting how the model perceives the overall message.

originality, freshness, offer
