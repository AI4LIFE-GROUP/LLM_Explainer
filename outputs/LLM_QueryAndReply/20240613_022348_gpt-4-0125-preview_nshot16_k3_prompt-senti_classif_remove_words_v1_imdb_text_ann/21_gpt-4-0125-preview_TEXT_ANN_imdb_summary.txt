Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"finally"** - Its removal is consistently associated with changes in the model's output in several instances, suggesting its importance in the overall sentiment or meaning as perceived by the model.

2. **"great"** - The removal of this word in different contexts also leads to changes in output, indicating its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis.

3. **"competent"** - This word, when removed, particularly in contexts where it changes the sentiment from positive to negative or vice versa, shows its importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

These words seem to carry significant weight in the model's interpretation of the sentence, affecting the sentiment or meaning derived from it.

finally, great, competent
