Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. The model's output changes based on the presence or absence of specific words in the sentence. By examining the dataset, we can identify patterns in the removals that lead to a change in output.

1. **"excellent"** - This word appears in every instance where its removal leads to a change in output. Its presence or absence seems to significantly influence the model's prediction, indicating its high importance.

2. **"drama" and "thriller"** - These words seem to have a lesser but still noticeable impact on the model's output. In cases where "excellent" is removed alongside these words, the output changes, suggesting that their combination with "excellent" contributes to the model's decision-making process. However, "excellent" appears to be the common factor in most changes, indicating that "drama" and "thriller" are of secondary importance.

3. **"film"** - This word also appears to influence the model's output but to a lesser extent compared to "excellent." Its removal in certain contexts changes the output, but it's often in conjunction with the removal of "excellent," making it difficult to attribute the change solely to "film."

Given this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact and frequency of appearance in the dataset, are:

excellent, drama, thriller
