Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. The dataset shows a pattern where the removal of certain words consistently leads to a change in output, specifically a decrease indicated by "-1". This change suggests a negative impact on the model's output when these words are omitted, highlighting their importance in the original sentence's sentiment or meaning.

The words "unique", "feeling", and "though" are removed in several instances, each time resulting in a change in output to "-1". This indicates that these words are crucial for maintaining the original output of the model. When they are removed, the model's output changes, suggesting that they carry significant sentiment or meaning that influences the model's prediction. Other words, when removed, do not consistently cause a change in output, indicating they are of lesser importance in this context.

Therefore, based on the dataset and the consistent change in output associated with their removal, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

unique, feeling, though
