Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output (from 0 to -1) indicates that the removed words had a significant impact on the model's prediction. Conversely, no change in output (remaining 0) suggests that the removed words were not as critical in determining the model's output.

1. **"style"** - Removing "the style" and variations involving "style" often leads to a change in output. This suggests that "style" is a key word in determining the model's prediction.

2. **"wonderfully"** - The removal of "wonderfully" in various combinations also leads to a change in output. This indicates its importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

3. **"appearance"** - The word "appearance" appears in several removals that result in a change in output. Its removal, especially when combined with other significant words, affects the model's prediction, highlighting its importance.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

style, wonderfully, appearance
