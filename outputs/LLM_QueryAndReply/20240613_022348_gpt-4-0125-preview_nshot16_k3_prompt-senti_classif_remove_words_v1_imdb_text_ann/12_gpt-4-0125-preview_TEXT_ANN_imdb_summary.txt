Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in the model's prediction, we look at the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output indicates the importance of the removed word(s) to the model's original prediction. In this dataset, the removal of certain words results in a change in output (specifically, a decrease), while the removal of others does not affect the output.

1. **"so"** - Every time "so" is removed, the change in output is consistently -1. This indicates a significant impact on the model's output, suggesting that "so" is a key word in determining the sentiment or overall interpretation by the model.

2. **"is"** - The removal of "is" alone also results in a change in output of -1 in multiple instances. This suggests that "is" plays a crucial role in the model's understanding or classification of the sentence.

3. **"this movie"** - When "this movie" is removed, the change in output is -1 in both instances it is mentioned. This indicates that the phrase "this movie" as a unit has a notable impact on the model's output, albeit less so than "so" or "is" individually.

Words like "awesome" and combinations that include it do not show a direct impact when removed, as seen by the 0 change in output in those scenarios. This suggests that while "awesome" is a positive word, its removal is counterbalanced by the model's interpretation of the remaining words, or it is not as crucial as the other words for the model's sentiment analysis in this specific context.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

so, is, this movie
