Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests a significant impact on the model's interpretation or prediction. 

1. **"movie"** - When "movie" is removed along with other words but not alone, the output tends to change (e.g., "she carries the" vs. "she carries the well ."), indicating its importance. However, its singular removal isn't directly shown, suggesting its importance is contextual rather than absolute.

2. **"well"** - The removal of "well" in various combinations (e.g., "carries well", "movie well .") leads to a change in output, indicating its significant role in the model's prediction. Its presence or absence in combinations affects the output, highlighting its importance.

3. **"carries"** - The word "carries" when removed with certain combinations (e.g., "she carries the", "carries well") changes the output. This suggests that "carries" has a notable but not the most critical role in influencing the model's prediction.

Given the dataset, the changes in output when these words are removed (either in isolation or in combination with others) indicate their level of importance in determining the model's prediction. The exact impact of each word is context-dependent, but their repeated involvement in changes of output highlights their significance.

movie, well, carries
