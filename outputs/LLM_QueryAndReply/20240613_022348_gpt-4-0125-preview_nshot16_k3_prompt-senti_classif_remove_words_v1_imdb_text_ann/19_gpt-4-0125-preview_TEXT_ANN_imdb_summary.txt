Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the instances where the removal of specific words or phrases resulted in a change in output (indicated by a change in output value from the original sentence). A change in output suggests that the removed words are significant in determining the model's interpretation or classification of the sentence.

1. **"if"**: The removal of "if" in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in setting the conditional context of the sentence.

2. **"not"**: The word "not" appears crucial in a few instances where its removal changes the output. This suggests its role in negating or altering the sentiment or factual content of the sentence is significant for the model's interpretation.

3. **"gross"**: The removal of "gross" also leads to a change in output in multiple instances. This word likely contributes significantly to the sentiment or descriptive quality of the movie being discussed, affecting the model's output.

These words seem to play a pivotal role in how the model interprets the sentiment or the conditions being described in the original sentence.

if, not, gross
