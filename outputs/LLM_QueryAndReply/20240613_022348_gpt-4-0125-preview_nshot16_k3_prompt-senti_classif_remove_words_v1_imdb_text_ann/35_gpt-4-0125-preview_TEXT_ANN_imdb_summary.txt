Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look for patterns in the dataset where the removal of specific words leads to a change in output. A change in output, especially a negative change, indicates that the removed words had a significant impact on the model's understanding or interpretation of the sentence.

From the dataset, we observe that the removal of "was," "second," and "movie" in various combinations frequently leads to a change in output, specifically a decrease (indicated by -1). This pattern suggests that these words are crucial for the model to maintain its original output. The presence of these words likely contributes to the model's understanding of the sentence's context or meaning, and their absence disrupts this understanding.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their apparent impact on the model's output, are:

was, second, movie
