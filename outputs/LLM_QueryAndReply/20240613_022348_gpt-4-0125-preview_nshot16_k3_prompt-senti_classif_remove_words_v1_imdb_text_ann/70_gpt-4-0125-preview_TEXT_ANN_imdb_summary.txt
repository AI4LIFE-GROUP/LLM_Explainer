Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"more"**: The removal of "more" often leads to a change in output (e.g., from 0 to -1 or vice versa), suggesting that it plays a crucial role in the model's understanding of the sentence's comparative degree or intensity.

2. **"holes"**: Similar to "more," the removal of "holes" also results in changes in output. Given the context of the original sentence, "holes" is critical in conveying the negative aspects of the plot, which significantly affects the model's sentiment analysis.

3. **"astonishingly"**: This word's removal is associated with changes in output in several instances. "Astonishingly" serves as an intensifier, amplifying the sentiment (in this case, negative) expressed towards the direction and editing, which seems to be crucial for the model's interpretation.

Based on the dataset and the observed changes in output, these words appear to be the most impactful on the model's predictions.

more, holes, astonishingly
