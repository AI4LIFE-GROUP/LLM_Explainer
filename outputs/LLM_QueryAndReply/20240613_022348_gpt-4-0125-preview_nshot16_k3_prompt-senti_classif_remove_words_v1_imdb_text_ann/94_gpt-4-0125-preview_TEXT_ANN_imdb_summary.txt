Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a positive sentiment given its content) indicates the importance of the removed words in contributing to that sentiment. Words that, when removed, lead to a negative change in output (-1), are likely crucial for the positive sentiment of the original sentence.

1. **"excellently"** - This word is directly associated with a positive qualifier and is removed in several instances where the change in output is -1, indicating its strong influence on the model's positive output.

2. **"produced"** - The removal of this word in several instances also leads to a change in output to -1. Given that it's part of a phrase that positively describes the film, its importance is highlighted in contributing to the positive sentiment.

3. **"tops"** or **"ratings"** - Both words appear to be significant, but "tops" might have a slight edge due to its positive connotation of being at the top or best. However, since they often appear together in removals leading to a negative output, it suggests both are important. Given the constraint to choose three words, "tops" is selected for its slightly more positive connotation.

Therefore, the top three most important words appear to be:

**excellently, produced, tops**
