Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the baseline (presumably 0 to -1 or vice versa) indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or classification of the sentence. 

1. **"lovely"** - This word's removal is consistently associated with a change in output in several instances, suggesting its importance in maintaining the original sentiment or classification of the sentence.

2. **"shenanigans"** - Similar to "lovely," the removal of "shenanigans" appears multiple times and is associated with a change in output, indicating its significance in the model's understanding of the sentence.

3. **"child"** - The word "child" is also removed in various instances that lead to a change in output. Its presence or absence seems to have a considerable impact on the model's decision, making it one of the key words.

Based on the dataset and the observed changes in output, these words seem to have the most significant influence on the model's predictions.

lovely, shenanigans, child
