Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates the importance of the removed words in determining the sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model. 

Looking at the dataset, the removals that lead to a change in output (specifically to -1) consistently involve the negation and action phrases, particularly with the words "don't," "waste," and "seen." These words are crucial in flipping the sentiment or meaning of the sentence. 

- The word "don't" is involved in negating the action, suggesting not to do something, which is pivotal in the context of the advice given in the original sentence.
- The word "waste" is key in conveying the negative sentiment towards spending time on the activity mentioned.
- The word "seen" is part of the phrase that sets the context for the advice, indicating the viewing of something.

When these words are removed, and the output changes significantly, it indicates their strong influence on the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment or directive. 

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact when removed, are:

don't, waste, seen
