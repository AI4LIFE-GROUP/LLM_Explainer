Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the patterns of word removals and the corresponding changes in output. The model's output changes between 1 and 0 based on the presence or absence of certain words. By examining the dataset, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output.

1. **"spoiler"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its significant influence on the model's decision-making process.

2. **"survivors"** - This word's removal in certain instances also leads to a change in output, suggesting its importance in the context of the sentence and its impact on the model's predictions.

3. **"solidifying"** - Although not as frequently removed as the first two, the removal of this word in specific instances where it leads to a change in output suggests its relevance in contributing to the model's understanding of the sentence's sentiment or meaning.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words appear to be:

spoiler, survivors, solidifying
