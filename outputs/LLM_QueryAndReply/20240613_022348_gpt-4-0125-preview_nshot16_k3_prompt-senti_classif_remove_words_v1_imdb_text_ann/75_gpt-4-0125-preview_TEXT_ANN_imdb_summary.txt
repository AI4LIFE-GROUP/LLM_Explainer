Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"not"**: The removal of "not" in various combinations often leads to a change in output (e.g., from 0 to -1 or vice versa), indicating its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis. Its presence or absence can flip the perceived sentiment or meaning of the sentence.

2. **"too"**: The word "too" appears in several instances where its removal, especially when combined with other key words like "not", changes the output. This suggests that "too" plays a role in moderating or intensifying the sentiment conveyed, thus affecting the model's output.

3. **"just"**: Similar to "not" and "too", the removal of "just" in certain contexts changes the model's output. "Just" seems to serve as a balancing word that can alter the perceived neutrality or extremeness of the sentiment.

Based on the dataset and the changes in model output associated with the removal of specific words, it appears that these words are crucial in determining the sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model.

not, too, just
