Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of specific words or phrases leads to a change in the model's output. A change in output suggests that the removed words are significant for the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"couldn't" and variations ("couldn", "couldn '")**: The removal of contractions related to "could not" seems to consistently influence the model's output. This suggests that the model heavily weighs the expression of doubt or negativity conveyed by "couldn't".

2. **"amazing"**: The word "amazing" appears to be crucial as well. Its removal in some instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in contributing to a positive sentiment of the sentence.

3. **"great"**: Similar to "amazing", "great" is associated with positive sentiment. Its removal in certain contexts changes the output, although it might not be as impactful as "couldn't" or "amazing" based on the dataset provided.

Given these observations, the top three most important words for the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, appear to be:

couldn't, amazing, great
