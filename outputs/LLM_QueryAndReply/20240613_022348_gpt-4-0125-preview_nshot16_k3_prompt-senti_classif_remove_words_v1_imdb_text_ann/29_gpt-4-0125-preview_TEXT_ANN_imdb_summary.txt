Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is directly influenced by the presence or absence of specific words in the original sentence. The model's output changes from 0 to -1 when certain words are removed, indicating a negative shift in sentiment or meaning. By examining the instances where the change in output is -1, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to this change.

The words "not," "sure," and "was" are frequently involved in removals that result in a change in output to -1. Particularly, the removal of "not" alone does not change the output (indicating its isolated removal is not sufficient to alter the sentiment detected by the model), but in combination with other words such as "sure" and "was," the output changes significantly. This suggests that these words contribute to the negation or the expression of uncertainty in the sentence, which is crucial for the model's interpretation of sentiment or meaning.

Given this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact when removed, appear to be:

not, sure, was
