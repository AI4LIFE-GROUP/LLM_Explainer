Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a baseline output) indicates the importance of the removed words in determining the sentiment or classification made by the model. 

Looking at the dataset, the changes in output occur when certain words are removed, suggesting these words are pivotal for the model's decision-making process. The words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output (from 0 to -1 or vice versa) can be considered as having a significant impact on the model's predictions.

1. **"garbage"** - Its removal in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its strong negative connotation influences the model's sentiment analysis.

2. **"not"** - The removal of this word in various contexts also leads to a change in output. Given that "not" is a negation word, its presence or absence can flip the sentiment of the sentence.

3. **"real"** - This word's removal in multiple cases results in a change in output, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in the model's interpretation of the sentence, likely affecting the authenticity or legitimacy aspect of the movie being discussed.

Therefore, the top three most important words appear to be:

garbage, not, real
