Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, it's clear that the model's output changes based on specific words being removed from the original sentence. The model outputs a change of -1 when certain words are removed, indicating these words have a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. By examining the instances where the change in output is -1, we can identify common words whose removal consistently leads to a change in output.

The words "plot," "acting," and "appalling" are frequently involved in scenarios where their removal leads to a change in output to -1. This suggests that these words are crucial for the model's understanding or sentiment analysis of the sentence. Specifically, "plot" and "acting" are critical components of any review related to movies or performances, indicating subjects of critique, while "appalling" strongly conveys negative sentiment. Their presence or absence significantly influences the model's output, indicating their importance in the model's evaluation process.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact when removed, are:

plot, acting, appalling
