Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the patterns of word removals and the corresponding changes in output. The model's output changes from 1 to 0 or vice versa when certain words are removed, indicating their importance in the model's decision-making process.

1. **"best"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1), suggesting its significant role in the model's prediction. It appears in multiple instances where its removal directly influences a change.

2. **"scene"** - Similar to "best," the word "scene" is involved in changes in the model's output in various instances. Its presence or absence seems to be a key factor in determining the model's output.

3. **"movie"** - The word "movie" also appears to be crucial. Its removal in certain contexts leads to a change in the model's output, indicating its importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

best, scene, movie
