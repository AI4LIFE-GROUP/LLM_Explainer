Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of specific words leads to a change in output. A change in output indicates the importance of the removed words in the model's decision-making process. 

Looking at the dataset, we notice that the removal of certain words consistently leads to a change in output (from 0 to -1), suggesting these words are crucial for the model to maintain its original output. Specifically, we observe that the word "length" appears multiple times in instances where its removal leads to a change in output. This indicates a high level of importance. Similarly, the removal of "but" and "of" also leads to changes in output in several cases, suggesting their significance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

Given this analysis, the top three most important words, based on their impact on the model's output when removed, appear to be:

length, but, of
