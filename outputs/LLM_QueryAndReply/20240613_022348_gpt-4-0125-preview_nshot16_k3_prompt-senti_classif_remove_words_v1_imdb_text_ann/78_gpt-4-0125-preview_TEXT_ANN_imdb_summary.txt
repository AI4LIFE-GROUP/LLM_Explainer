Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests a significant impact by the removed words on the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"excuse"** - The removal of "excuse" in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., from 1 to 0 or vice versa), indicating its strong influence on the model's prediction. When "excuse" is removed, the output tends to switch, suggesting its pivotal role in the sentence's sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model.

2. **"poorly"** - The word "poorly" also appears to be crucial. Its removal in various combinations affects the output change, highlighting its importance in contributing to the model's interpretation of the sentence. 

3. **"no"** - The word "no" seems to be significant as well. Its removal, especially in combinations where other key words like "excuse" and "poorly" are present or absent, influences the output change, indicating its role in the overall sentiment or meaning of the sentence.

These words, when removed, consistently lead to changes in the model's output, suggesting they are critical in how the model interprets the sentiment or meaning of the original sentence.

excuse, poorly, no
