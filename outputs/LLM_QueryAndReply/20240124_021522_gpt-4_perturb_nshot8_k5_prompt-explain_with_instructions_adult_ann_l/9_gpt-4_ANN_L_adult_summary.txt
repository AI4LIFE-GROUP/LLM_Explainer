Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. However, the output does not seem to be directly correlated with the changes in 'A'. The importance of 'A' in determining the output is rated as 30.

2. Feature 'B': This feature shows mostly positive changes in the input. The output seems to be positively correlated with the changes in 'B'. The importance of 'B' in determining the output is rated as 60. Compared to 'A', 'B' is more important. So, the running rank is BA.

3. Feature 'C': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. The output does not seem to be directly correlated with the changes in 'C'. The importance of 'C' in determining the output is rated as 40. Compared to 'A' and 'B', 'C' is more important than 'A' but less important than 'B'. So, the running rank is BCA.

4. Feature 'D': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. The output seems to be positively correlated with the changes in 'D'. The importance of 'D' in determining the output is rated as 70. Compared to 'A', 'B', and 'C', 'D' is the most important. So, the running rank is DBCA.

5. Feature 'E': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. The output does not seem to be directly correlated with the changes in 'E'. The importance of 'E' in determining the output is rated as 50. Compared to 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D', 'E' is more important than 'A' and 'C' but less important than 'B' and 'D'. So, the running rank is DBECA.

6. Feature 'F': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. The output does not seem to be directly correlated with the changes in 'F'. The importance of 'F' in determining the output is rated as 40. Compared to the other features, 'F' is more important than 'A' but less important than 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'. So, the running rank is DBECAF.

7. Feature 'G': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. The output does not seem to be directly correlated with the changes in 'G'. The importance of 'G' in determining the output is rated as 40. Compared to the other features, 'G' is more important than 'A' but less important than 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', and 'F'. So, the running rank is DBECAFG.

8. Feature 'H': This feature shows both positive and negative changes in the input. The output does not seem to be directly correlated with the changes in 'H'. The importance of 'H' in determining the output is rated as 40. Compared to the other features, 'H' is more important than 'A' but less important than 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
