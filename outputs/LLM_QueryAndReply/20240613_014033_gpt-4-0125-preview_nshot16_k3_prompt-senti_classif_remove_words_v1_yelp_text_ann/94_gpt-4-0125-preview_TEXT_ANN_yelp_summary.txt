Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. By examining the dataset, we notice that the removal of certain words consistently leads to a change in output, particularly when these words are critical in conveying the negative sentiment of the original sentence.

1. **"not"**: The removal of "not" in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in conveying the negative sentiment of the sentence. Its presence or absence directly flips the sentiment perceived by the model.

2. **"was"**: The word "was" seems to play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and coherence of the sentence, affecting the model's output when removed. It's a verb that's central to the statement's sentiment and factual description.

3. **"greatest"**: This adjective, especially when combined with "not" in the original sentence, significantly contributes to the sentiment being expressed. Its removal in contexts where the output changes suggests it's key in modulating the intensity of the mood described.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

not, was, greatest
