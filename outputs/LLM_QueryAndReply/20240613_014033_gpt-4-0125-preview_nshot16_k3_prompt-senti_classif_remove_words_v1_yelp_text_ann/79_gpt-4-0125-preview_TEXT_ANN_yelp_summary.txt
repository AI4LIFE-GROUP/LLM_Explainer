Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words are significant for the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"comfortable"** - When "comfortable" is removed (along with other words in some instances), there's a consistent pattern where the change in output is observed. This indicates that "comfortable" is a key word for the model's output. Its presence or absence significantly influences the model's decision, suggesting it's highly important.

2. **"patio"** - The removal of "patio" alone or with other words also leads to a change in output in several instances. This suggests that "patio" is another important word for the model's prediction. It's not as consistently impactful as "comfortable" but still plays a significant role.

3. **"seating"** - The word "seating" shows a mixed influence on the model's output. However, its removal in combinations where "patio" and/or "comfortable" are also removed tends to contribute to a change in output. This suggests that "seating" has an impact, albeit less than "comfortable" and "patio," but still ranks among the top three in terms of importance.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

comfortable, patio, seating
