Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is primarily influenced by the presence or absence of certain words. When the output changes from 0 to -1, it indicates a significant shift in the model's interpretation of the sentiment or meaning of the sentence. By examining the instances where the change in output is -1, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in the model's output.

1. **"i"**: The removal of the word "i" in several instances leads to a change in output to -1. This suggests that the presence of the subject "i" is crucial for maintaining the original sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model.

2. **"was"**: The word "was" appears in multiple instances where its removal leads to a change in output. This indicates its importance in the construction of the sentence that affects the model's interpretation.

3. **"deeply"**: The removal of "deeply" in certain contexts also leads to a change in output. Given that "deeply" modifies "disappointed," its presence significantly impacts the intensity of the sentiment being expressed, thereby influencing the model's output.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

i, was, deeply
