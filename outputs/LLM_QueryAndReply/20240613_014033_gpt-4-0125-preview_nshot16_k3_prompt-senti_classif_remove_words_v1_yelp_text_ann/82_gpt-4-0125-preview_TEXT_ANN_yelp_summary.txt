Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output (from 0 to 1 or vice versa) indicates a significant impact on the model's decision-making process. By examining the dataset, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output.

1. **"every"** - The removal of "every" leads to a change in output in multiple instances (e.g., from the original sentence, when removed along with "will", "m", and "vegas", and when removed with "come", "‘", and "vegas"). This suggests that "every" plays a crucial role in the model's output.

2. **"will"** - The word "will" also appears to significantly affect the model's output when removed, especially when considered in conjunction with other words. Its removal in different combinations (e.g., with "in", "back here every time i ' in", and alone with "come back every time i m in") changes the output, indicating its importance.

3. **"come"** - The removal of "come" in various combinations (e.g., with "back here every time ' m in .", "every ' vegas", and alone in "will come back every time i m in") leads to a change in output, suggesting it is a key word affecting the model's prediction.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

every, will, come
