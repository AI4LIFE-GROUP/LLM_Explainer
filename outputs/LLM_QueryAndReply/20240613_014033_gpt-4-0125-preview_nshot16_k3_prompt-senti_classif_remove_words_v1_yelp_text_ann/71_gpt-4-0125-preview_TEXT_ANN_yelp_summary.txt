Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence to a different value (e.g., from 1 to 0 or vice versa) indicates the importance of the removed words in determining the model's prediction. Words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, can be considered important for the model's decision-making process.

1. **"excellent"** - The removal of "excellent" alone changes the output to 1, and its presence in multiple removals that lead to a change in output suggests its high importance.

2. **"very"** - The word "very" appears in several removals that change the output, indicating its role in modifying the sentiment conveyed by adjectives like "good," thus affecting the model's output significantly.

3. **"good"** - Similar to "excellent," the removal of "good" or its presence in combinations that change the output highlights its importance in contributing to the model's sentiment analysis.

These observations suggest that the model heavily weighs these specific adjectives and adverbs in determining the sentiment of the sentence, with "excellent" likely being the strongest indicator of positive sentiment, followed by intensifiers like "very" that amplify the sentiment of adjacent adjectives, and "good" as another positive sentiment indicator.

excellent, very, good
