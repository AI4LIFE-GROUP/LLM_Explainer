Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look for patterns in the dataset where the removal of specific words consistently leads to a change in output. A change in output, especially from 0 to -1, indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment or meaning.

1. **"bad"** - The removal of "bad" in several instances leads to a change in output from 0 to -1. This suggests that "bad" is crucial for the model to interpret the sentence negatively.

2. **"barely"** - The word "barely" appears in contexts where its removal also leads to a change in output. Its presence or absence seems to affect the model's understanding of the extent or degree of the sentiment expressed.

3. **"touched"** - Similar to "barely," the removal of "touched" in certain contexts changes the output. This indicates its importance in conveying the complete sentiment or action related to the subject matter.

These words, when removed, consistently affect the model's output, indicating their significant role in the sentence's overall sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model.

bad, barely, touched
