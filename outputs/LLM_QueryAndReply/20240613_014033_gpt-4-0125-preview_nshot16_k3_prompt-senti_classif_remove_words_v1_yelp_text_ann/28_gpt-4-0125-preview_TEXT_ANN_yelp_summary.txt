Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. The model's output changes from 1 to 0 or vice versa based on the removal of specific words, indicating their importance in the model's decision-making process.

1. **"good"** - This word appears in multiple removals that lead to a change in output. Its removal often correlates with a change, suggesting it's a key word in determining the sentiment or quality assessment in the sentence.

2. **"was"** - The word "was" appears frequently alongside "good" in removals that result in a change in output. Its presence seems to be tied closely with "good," indicating it plays a significant role in the model's interpretation of the sentence as positive.

3. **"prices"** - The word "prices" appears in several instances where its removal leads to a change in output. This suggests that "prices" is also an important factor for the model, likely because it relates to the aspect of cost which is a significant part of service and product evaluation.

Therefore, the top three most important words appear to be:

good, was, prices
