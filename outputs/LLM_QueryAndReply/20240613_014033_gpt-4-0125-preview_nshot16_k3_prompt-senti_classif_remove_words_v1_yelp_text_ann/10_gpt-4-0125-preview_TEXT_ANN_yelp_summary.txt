Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look for patterns in the dataset where the removal of specific words consistently leads to a change in output. A change in output, especially a negative change, indicates that the removed word(s) had a significant impact on the model's interpretation of the sentence.

1. **"also"** - The removal of "also" in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., "the was also really large that ." and "was also good and large that ."), suggesting its importance in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence.

2. **"good"** - The word "good" appears in multiple removals that result in a change in output (e.g., "was really good and pretty large at ." and "the pancake was really good and large at that"), indicating its significance in contributing to the positive sentiment of the original sentence.

3. **"large"** - Similar to "good," the removal of "large" in various contexts (e.g., "was really good and pretty large at ." and "the pancake was really good and large at that") also leads to a change in output, suggesting its role in the overall positive assessment of the pancake.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

also, good, large
