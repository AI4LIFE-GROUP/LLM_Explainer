Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or classification of the sentence. 

1. **"was"** - The removal of "was" alone led to a change in output (0), indicating its critical role in the sentence's interpretation by the model. This suggests that "was" is pivotal in maintaining the original meaning or sentiment of the sentence.

2. **"absolutely"** - The removal of "absolutely" in various combinations where other significant content words were also removed (e.g., "thus far have twice and the food was absolutely each") did not always directly correlate with a change in output. However, its presence in sentences that maintained the original output value (1) when other words were removed indicates its importance in contributing to the positive sentiment or specific interpretation by the model.

3. **"delicious"** - Similar to "absolutely," "delicious" appears in contexts where its removal, among others, leads to a change in output. It is closely tied to the positive sentiment of the sentence, and its removal in certain contexts where the output changes to 0 suggests its importance.

Given the dataset and the changes in model output based on the words removed, the top three most important words for the model's prediction, considering their impact and frequency in changes, are:

was, absolutely, delicious
