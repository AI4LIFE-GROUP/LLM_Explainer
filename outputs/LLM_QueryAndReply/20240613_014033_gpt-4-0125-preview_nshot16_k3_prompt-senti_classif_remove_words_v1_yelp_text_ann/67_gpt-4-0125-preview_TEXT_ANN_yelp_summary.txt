Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look for patterns in the dataset where the removal of specific words consistently leads to a change in output. A change in output, whether from 0 to -1 or vice versa, indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment or meaning.

1. **"thumbs" and "up"**: These two words appear together in several instances where their removal leads to a change in output. Notably, when both are removed, the output changes, suggesting their combined presence is crucial for maintaining the original sentiment of the sentence. Their repeated involvement in changes of output when removed together highlights their importance.

2. **"way"**: The word "way" also seems to play a significant role. Its removal in different combinations leads to a change in output, especially when removed alongside other key words. This suggests that "way" contributes to intensifying the sentiment expressed in the original sentence, affecting the model's output when absent.

3. **"is"**: Although "is" might seem like a simple linking verb with less semantic weight, its removal in certain contexts leads to a change in output. This indicates that "is" contributes to the structural integrity of the sentence, affecting how the model interprets the overall sentiment.

Given these observations, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, based on their impact on the change in output, are:

thumbs, up, way
