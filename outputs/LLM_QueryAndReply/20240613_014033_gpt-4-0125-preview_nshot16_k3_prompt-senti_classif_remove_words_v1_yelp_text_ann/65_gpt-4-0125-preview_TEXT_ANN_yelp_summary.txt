Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"totally"** - Removing this word consistently results in a change in output to -1, indicating its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis. Whether it's removed alone or with other words, its absence notably shifts the model's output.

2. **"blows"** - The removal of this word in one instance does not change the output, suggesting it might not be as critical alone. However, considering the original sentence's sentiment and the unchanged output when it's removed with other words, it seems to play a key role in the context of the sentence but is not as impactful on the model's change in output as "totally."

3. **"live"** and **"music"** - These words seem to have a lesser impact compared to "totally" when removed, as their removal does not change the output. However, when "live music" is removed together with other words that lead to a change in output, it indicates their contextual importance but not as direct influencers on the sentiment change as "totally."

Given the analysis, the word "totally" stands out as the most significant, followed by "blows" due to its contextual importance, and "live" or "music" could be considered next in line for their contextual relevance. However, since "live" and "music" together do not directly cause a change in output, we prioritize "blows" over them for its direct involvement in the sentence's sentiment.

Answer: totally, blows, live
