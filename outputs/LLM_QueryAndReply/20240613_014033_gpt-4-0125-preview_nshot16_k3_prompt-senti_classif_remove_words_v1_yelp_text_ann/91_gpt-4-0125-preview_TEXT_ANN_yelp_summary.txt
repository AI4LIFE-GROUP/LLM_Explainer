Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"daily specials"** - The removal of "daily specials" in various combinations often leads to a change in output, indicating its importance. For instance, when "daily specials" is part of the removed phrase, the change in output is frequently observed, suggesting these words are crucial for the model's prediction.

2. **"are"** - The word "are" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output. Its presence or absence in different combinations that affect the output suggests it plays a significant role in the model's prediction mechanism.

3. **"hit"** - The word "hit" is also a common factor in removals that result in a change in output. This indicates that "hit" is a key word for the model's understanding or interpretation of the sentence.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words appear to be:

daily specials, are, hit
