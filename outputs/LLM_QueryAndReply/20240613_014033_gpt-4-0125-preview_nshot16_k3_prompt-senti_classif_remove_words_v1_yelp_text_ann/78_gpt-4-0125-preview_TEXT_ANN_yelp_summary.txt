Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output in relation to the words removed. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation of the sentence. By comparing instances where the removal of specific words leads to a change in output, we can identify which words are most critical.

1. **"waiting"**: The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in the model's interpretation of the customer's experience related to service time.

2. **"minutes"**: This word appears frequently in changes that lead to a negative output, suggesting its role in quantifying the waiting time, thus affecting the model's perception of the delay.

3. **"order"**: The removal of this word in various contexts also leads to a change in output, highlighting its significance in understanding the context of the dining experience, specifically the act of placing an order.

These words are crucial in the model's interpretation of the sentence, as their removal significantly alters the model's output, indicating the negative aspects of the dining experience related to service time and the ordering process.

waiting, minutes, order
