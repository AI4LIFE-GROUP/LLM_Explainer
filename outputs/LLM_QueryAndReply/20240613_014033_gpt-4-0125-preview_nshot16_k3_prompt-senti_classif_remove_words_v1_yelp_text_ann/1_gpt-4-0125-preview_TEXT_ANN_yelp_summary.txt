Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we observe that the model's output changes from 0 to -1 when certain words are removed from the original sentence. The change in output seems to be particularly sensitive to the removal of specific words. By examining the instances where the change in output is -1, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a negative change in the model's output.

1. **Worst**: The removal of "worst" consistently results in a change in output to -1 across multiple instances. This indicates that the word "worst" plays a significant role in the model's original negative output.

2. **Food/Service**: The removal of "food/service" in combination with other words (especially "worst") also leads to a change in output to -1 in several instances. However, when "food/service" is removed without "worst," the change in output is not consistently negative. This suggests that "food/service" is important but not as critical as "worst" in isolation.

3. **I've/I 've/I ve**: The variations of "I've" appear in several removals that lead to a change in output to -1. However, its role seems to be more about the sentence structure rather than the sentiment itself. Its importance seems to be less about the specific sentiment and more about how it connects the sentiment to the subject.

Given these observations, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

worst, food/service, i've
