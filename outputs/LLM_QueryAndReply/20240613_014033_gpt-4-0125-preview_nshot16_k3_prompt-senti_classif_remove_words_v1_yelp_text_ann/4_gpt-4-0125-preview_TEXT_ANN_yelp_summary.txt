Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"avoid"** - When "avoid" is removed, the change in output is 0, indicating its presence is crucial for the model to interpret the sentence negatively.

2. **"sushi"** - The removal of "sushi" along with other combinations where the output changes to 0 suggests that "sushi" is also a key word. However, its importance seems to be secondary to "avoid" because its removal alone does not always result in a change in output.

3. **"lover"** - Similar to "sushi," the word "lover" appears in several combinations where its removal leads to a change in output. This suggests it has some importance in the model's interpretation but less so than "avoid" and "sushi."

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

avoid, sushi, lover
