Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for maintaining the original meaning or sentiment of the sentence.

Looking at the dataset, the removal of "we," "were," and "and" consistently leads to a change in output from 0 to -1. This pattern suggests that these words play a significant role in the model's interpretation of the sentence. Specifically, the removal of "we" appears in multiple instances where the change in output is -1, indicating its importance in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "were" and "and" are also removed in instances leading to a negative change in output, highlighting their significance.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the dataset and the impact of word removal on the model's output, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

we, were, and
