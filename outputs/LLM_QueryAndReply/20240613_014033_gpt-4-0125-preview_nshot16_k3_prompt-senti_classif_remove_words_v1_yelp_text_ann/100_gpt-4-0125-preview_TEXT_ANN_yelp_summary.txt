Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is consistently 1 when the phrase "the nachos are a have !" is removed, indicating that the removal of this specific combination of words has a significant impact on the model's output. However, this phrase contains multiple words, and we need to identify individual words whose removal consistently leads to a change in output.

Looking closely, the removal of individual words such as "a", "are", and "the" results in no change in output (indicated by 0), suggesting these words are not crucial for the model's prediction on their own. The critical observation is that the model's output changes when the phrase without "MUST HAVE!" is removed, but when words that are part of this phrase are not removed, the output does not change. This pattern suggests that "MUST HAVE" is crucial for the change in the model's output. Since "MUST" and "HAVE" are the only words not individually tested for removal in the dataset but are part of the phrases that, when removed, change the output, it implies these words are significant. The exclamation mark "!" is also tested, and its removal leads to no change, indicating it's not as crucial as "MUST" and "HAVE".

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, based on the given dataset and the influence of word removal on the change in output, ranked from most important to least important, are:

MUST, HAVE, nachos
