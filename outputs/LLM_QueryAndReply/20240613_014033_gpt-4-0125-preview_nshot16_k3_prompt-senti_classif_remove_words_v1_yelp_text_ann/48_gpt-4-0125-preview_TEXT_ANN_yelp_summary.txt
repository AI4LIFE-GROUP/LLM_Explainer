Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. Words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output can be considered as having a significant impact on the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"joke"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in the context of the sentence. It's a key element in understanding the sentiment or the nature of the place being described.

2. **"publicly"** - This word's removal also seems to affect the output notably. It contributes to the context of the action being taken by the speaker and their friends, emphasizing the visibility of their opinion.

3. **"loudly"** - Similar to "publicly," the removal of "loudly" impacts the output, which suggests its role in describing how the opinion is expressed, adding to the intensity or manner of the action.

These words collectively contribute to the overall sentiment and intensity of the statement, which seems to be crucial for the model's prediction on the nature of the statement being positive, negative, or neutral.

joke, publicly, loudly
