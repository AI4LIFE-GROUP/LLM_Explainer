Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. The output changes between 1 and 0, where certain removals lead to a consistent change in the model's output. By examining the dataset, we can identify patterns in word removals that consistently result in a change in output.

1. **"delicious"** - The removal of this word in various contexts often leads to a change in output. This suggests that the sentiment or quality conveyed by "delicious" plays a crucial role in the model's decision-making process.

2. **"!" (exclamation mark)** - The presence or absence of the exclamation mark seems to influence the output significantly. Its removal in some contexts changes the output, indicating its importance in expressing enthusiasm or a positive sentiment.

3. **"tapas"** - This word, when removed in certain combinations, leads to a change in output. It seems to be less impactful than "delicious" or "!", but it still plays a role, likely because it specifies the subject matter of the sentence, contributing to the context the model uses to determine its output.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction are:

delicious, !, tapas
