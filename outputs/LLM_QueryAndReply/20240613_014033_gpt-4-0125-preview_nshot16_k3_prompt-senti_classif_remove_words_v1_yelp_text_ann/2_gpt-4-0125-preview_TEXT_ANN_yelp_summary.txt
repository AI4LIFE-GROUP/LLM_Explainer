Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation of the sentence, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for maintaining the original sentiment or meaning.

From the dataset, we observe that the removal of "never," "again," and "will" in various combinations frequently leads to a change in output from 0 to -1. This suggests that these words play a pivotal role in the model's prediction. Specifically, the word "never" appears in several instances where its removal causes a shift to -1, indicating a strong negative sentiment or a definitive refusal that is crucial for the model's understanding of the sentence. Similarly, "again" and "will" are involved in changes that suggest their importance in conveying the sentence's sentiment or intent.

Considering the frequency and impact of these words' removal on the model's output change, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

never, again, will
