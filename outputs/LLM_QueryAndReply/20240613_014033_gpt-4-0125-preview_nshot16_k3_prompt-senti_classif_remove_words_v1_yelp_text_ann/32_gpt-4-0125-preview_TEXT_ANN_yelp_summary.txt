Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence likely indicates the importance of the removed words in determining the model's prediction. 

1. **"must"** - Removing "must" alone changes the output to 0, indicating its significant influence on the model's positive prediction ("1" in the original sentence). Whenever "must" is removed, regardless of the other words removed alongside it, the output changes to 0, highlighting its importance.

2. **"absolute"** - The removal of "absolute" in various combinations also leads to a change in output to 0 in some cases, but not as consistently as "must". This suggests that "absolute" has an impact, but it's not as critical as "must" for maintaining the original positive output.

3. **"visit"** - The word "visit" appears in many removals that lead to a change in output to 1 when removed alongside other words, but its removal alone or in certain combinations doesn't consistently flip the output to 0 as "must" does. This indicates a lesser degree of importance compared to "must" and "absolute".

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

must, absolute, visit
