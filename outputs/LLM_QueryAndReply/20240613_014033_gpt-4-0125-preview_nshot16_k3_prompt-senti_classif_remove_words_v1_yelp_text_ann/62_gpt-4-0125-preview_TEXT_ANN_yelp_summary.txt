Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of specific words leads to a change in output. A change in output suggests that the removed words are significant for the model's decision-making process. 

1. The word "very" when removed alone does not change the output (Change in output: 0), indicating that its presence or absence alone is not crucial for the model's prediction in this context.

2. The removal of "disappointed" is not explicitly listed, but looking at the sentences where larger chunks are removed, including sentiments and descriptions of the experience (like being "very disappointed"), tends to flip the output to 1, suggesting that sentiment-related words are crucial. However, since "disappointed" is not directly tested, its direct impact is inferred from context.

3. The word "my" when removed alone changes the output to 1, indicating a significant impact on the model's prediction. This suggests that the ownership or personal experience aspect conveyed by "my" is important for the model's interpretation.

4. Words related to the act of eating ("ate lunch") or the subjects ("husband", "I") when removed together with other words sometimes change the output, but it's the combination that seems to matter rather than any single word's presence.

Given these observations, the most important words for the model's prediction seem to be related to the personal aspect ("my"), the sentiment or quality of the experience, and possibly the subject or action. However, since "disappointed" is not directly tested and "very" alone doesn't change the output, we focus on what directly changes the model's output when altered.

Therefore, the top three most important words based on the given dataset and the reasoning above are:

my, very, husband
