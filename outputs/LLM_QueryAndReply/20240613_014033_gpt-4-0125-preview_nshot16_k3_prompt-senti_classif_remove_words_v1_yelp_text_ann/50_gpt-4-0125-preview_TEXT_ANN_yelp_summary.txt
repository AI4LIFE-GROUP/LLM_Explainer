Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"unbelievably"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., when removed along with other words, the output changes, but its isolated removal also changes the output). This indicates its strong influence on the model's perception of the sentence.

2. **"glad"** - This word, when removed, especially in combinations that lead to a change in output, suggests its importance in contributing to the positive sentiment of the sentence. Its presence or absence in various combinations that affect the output highlights its significance.

3. **"both"** - The removal of "both" in various combinations that leads to a change in output suggests it has a notable impact on the model's interpretation. It seems to affect how the model perceives the subject or plurality, influencing the overall sentiment or meaning captured by the model.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

unbelievably, glad, both
