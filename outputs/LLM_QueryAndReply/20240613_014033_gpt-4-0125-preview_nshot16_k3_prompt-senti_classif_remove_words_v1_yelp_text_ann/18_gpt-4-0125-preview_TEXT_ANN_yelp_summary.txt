Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is influenced by the presence or absence of specific words. When looking for patterns, we focus on instances where the removal of words leads to a change in output (from 0 to -1 or vice versa). The words that, when removed, consistently lead to a negative change in output are likely to be key in determining the model's prediction.

1. **"disgusted"** - The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output, indicating its significant role in the model's prediction. For example, removing "i was disgusted" changes the output to -1, suggesting that "disgusted" is crucial for maintaining the original sentiment or output.

2. **"because"** - This word appears to be important as well, especially when its removal, along with other words, results in a change in output. It seems to play a role in the logical structure of the sentence that affects the model's interpretation.

3. **"sure"** - The removal of "sure" in different contexts also leads to a change in output. This suggests that "sure" contributes to the certainty or intensity of the sentiment being expressed, influencing the model's prediction.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction appear to be:

disgusted, because, sure
