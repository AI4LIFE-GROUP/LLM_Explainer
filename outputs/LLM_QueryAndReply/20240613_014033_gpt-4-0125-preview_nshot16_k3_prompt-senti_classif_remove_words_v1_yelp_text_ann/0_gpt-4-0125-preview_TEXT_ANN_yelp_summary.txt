Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence likely indicates the importance of the removed words in the model's decision-making process. 

1. **"awful"** - Removing this word changes the output from 1 to 0, indicating its strong influence on the model's negative sentiment prediction. This is a clear indicator of its importance.

2. **"presentation"** - The removal of this word in some instances changes the output, but it's particularly telling when its removal alone changes the output to 1, suggesting its presence contributes significantly to the model's original output.

3. **"food"** - This word's removal, especially when combined with "awful", changes the output to 0, indicating its role in the context of the sentence. However, its influence seems to be more contextual rather than as direct as "awful" or "presentation".

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

awful, presentation, food
