Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"loved"** - The removal of "loved" in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., from 1 to 0 or vice versa), indicating its strong influence on the model's sentiment analysis. This word directly relates to the expression of a positive sentiment.

2. **"delicious"** - This word, when removed, also affects the change in output in several cases. Like "loved," "delicious" is a strong positive sentiment indicator, suggesting its importance in the model's analysis.

3. **"tender"** - The removal of "tender" in one instance changes the output, indicating its relevance but to a lesser extent compared to "loved" and "delicious." Since "tender" is also a positive descriptor, especially in the context of food, it plays a role in the model's sentiment analysis but is not as impactful as the first two.

Based on the dataset and the changes in model output associated with the removal of specific words, it appears that the model heavily weighs positive sentiment words in its analysis.

loved, delicious, tender
