Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, we notice that the change in output is closely tied to the presence or absence of specific words in the removed words list. When the output changes (to -1), it indicates that the removal of certain words significantly alters the model's interpretation or sentiment of the sentence. Conversely, when the output remains unchanged (0), it suggests that the removed words are not as critical to the model's interpretation.

1. **"just"** - The removal of "just" alone does not change the output, indicating that while it may contribute to the nuance of the sentence, it is not pivotal by itself for the model's output.

2. **"warm"** - Appears frequently in both lists where the output changes and where it does not. However, its presence or absence alone does not consistently influence the output change, suggesting it has a moderate impact.

3. **"tasted"**, **"like"**, **"tomato"**, **"soup"**, **"frozen"**, **"meatballs"** - These words, especially when removed together, seem to have a significant impact on the output change to -1. This suggests that they are crucial for the model's interpretation of the sentence, likely because they contribute to the descriptive quality of the sentence, affecting sentiment analysis.

Given the above analysis, the words that are most impactful seem to be those that contribute to the descriptive nature of the sentence, particularly in terms of the food's quality and the diner's experience.

Answer: tasted, like, tomato
