Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the patterns of word removals and the corresponding changes in output. A change in output likely indicates the removal of a word that is significant to the model's decision-making process. By examining the dataset, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output.

1. **"isn"**: The removal of "isn" or its variations ("isn't", "isn 't", etc.) frequently leads to a change in output. This suggests that the negation is crucial for the model's interpretation of the sentence.

2. **"family"**: The word "family" appears in several instances where its removal changes the output. This indicates its importance in distinguishing the type of restaurant described.

3. **"fine"**: Similar to "family", the word "fine" is involved in changes in output, especially when distinguishing the type of dining experience.

These observations suggest that negation ("isn"), along with key descriptive words ("family", "fine"), play significant roles in how the model interprets the sentence.

isn, family, fine
