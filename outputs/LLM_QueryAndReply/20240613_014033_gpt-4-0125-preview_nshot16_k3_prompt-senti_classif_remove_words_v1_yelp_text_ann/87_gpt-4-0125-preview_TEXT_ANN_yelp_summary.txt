Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we should look at the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from the original sentence (which has a change in output of 0) to a negative value indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction. Therefore, words whose removal leads to a negative change in output are considered important for the model's prediction.

1. The word "I" is removed in several instances where the change in output is -1 (e.g., "i d eat airline seriously .", "i ' rather eat , .", "i d seriously .", "i d rather eat airline food , ."), indicating its importance.
2. The word "seriously" is also removed in instances leading to a negative change in output (e.g., "i d eat airline seriously .", "i d seriously ."), suggesting its significance.
3. The word "eat" is another word whose removal often results in a negative change in output (e.g., "i d eat airline seriously .", "' eat airline food"), pointing to its relevance.

Considering the frequency and impact of these words' removal on the change in output, the top three most important words appear to be:

I, seriously, eat
