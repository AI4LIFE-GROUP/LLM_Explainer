Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence suggests that the removed words significantly impact the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"promise"** - When "promise" is removed, the change in output is inconsistent, indicating its presence or absence significantly affects the model's output. For example, removing "promise to" results in no change, but removing "this promise but fails" leads to a change. This inconsistency suggests that "promise" in conjunction with other words can flip the model's output, highlighting its importance.

2. **"fails"** - The word "fails" appears to be crucial as well. Its removal in various combinations ("this place has a lot of promise but fails deliver", "this promise but fails", "this place has a lot of promise fails to deliver .") often results in a change in output. This indicates that "fails" is a key word that the model relies on to determine the sentiment or meaning of the sentence.

3. **"deliver"** - The removal of "deliver" alone ("deliver") does not change the output, suggesting that by itself, it might not be as critical. However, in combinations where its removal alongside other words leads to a change in output, it indicates that "deliver" plays a significant role in conjunction with other words to influence the model's prediction.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

promise, fails, deliver
