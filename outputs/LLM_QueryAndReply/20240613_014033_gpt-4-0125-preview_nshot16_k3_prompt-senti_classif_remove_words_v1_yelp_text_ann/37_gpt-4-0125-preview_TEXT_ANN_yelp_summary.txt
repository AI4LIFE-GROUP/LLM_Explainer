Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output (from 0 to -1) indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **Lobster**: Removing "lobster" alone does not change the output, but its presence in combinations that lead to a change in output suggests its contextual importance. However, its importance seems less direct compared to other words, as its removal in some contexts does not alter the output.

2. **Soup**: The word "soup" appears in several removals that lead to a change in output. Specifically, when "soup" is removed along with other words like "had lobster soup" or "the lobster soup," there's a change in output, indicating its significant role in the sentence's context.

3. **Had**: The word "had" appears in multiple instances where its removal, especially in combination with other keywords, leads to a change in output. This suggests that "had" plays a crucial role in the sentence structure and meaning, affecting the model's interpretation.

Considering the frequency and context in which the removal of these words changes the output, it appears that the model's prediction is most sensitive to changes involving these words. However, the direct impact of "lobster" is less clear than "soup" and "had," which are directly involved in changes. "Lobster" seems to contribute to the context but does not independently affect the output as much as its combination with other words.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

soup, had, lobster
