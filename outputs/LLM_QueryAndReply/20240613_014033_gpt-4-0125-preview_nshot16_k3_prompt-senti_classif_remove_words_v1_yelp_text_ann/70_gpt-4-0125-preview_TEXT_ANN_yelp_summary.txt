REPLY:
Analyzing the dataset, it's evident that the model's output changes based on specific words being removed from the original sentence. When the words "love," "decor," and "Chinese calligraphy" are removed, there's a consistent pattern of change in the model's output. Particularly, the removal of "love" and combinations including "decor" and "Chinese calligraphy" frequently result in a change in output. This suggests that these words are significant in determining the model's prediction. The word "love" appears to be the most critical, as its removal consistently results in a change in output, followed by "decor" and "Chinese calligraphy," which when removed together with "love" or in certain combinations, also influence the output significantly.

love, decor, Chinese calligraphy
