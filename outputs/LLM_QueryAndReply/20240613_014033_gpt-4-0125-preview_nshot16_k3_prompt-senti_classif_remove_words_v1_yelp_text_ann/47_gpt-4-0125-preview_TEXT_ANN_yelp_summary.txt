Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output relative to the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence indicates a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence. 

1. **"wasn't" (and its variations "wasn", "t", "wasn 't")**: Removing variations of "wasn't" often leads to a change in output, indicating its importance in conveying the negative sentiment of the sentence. 

2. **"helpful"**: The removal of "helpful" in various contexts sometimes changes the output and sometimes does not, suggesting its role in the sentence's sentiment but also indicating that its absence can be mitigated by the presence of other words.

3. **"friendly"**: Similar to "helpful", "friendly" and its context within the removals show an impact on the model's output, albeit its influence seems slightly less direct than "wasn't" or "helpful".

These words are crucial in conveying the negative sentiment of the original sentence. "wasn't" directly negates any positive qualities, making it the most impactful. "helpful" and "friendly" are attributes being negated, contributing to the overall negative sentiment. The frequency and context of changes in output when these words are removed highlight their importance.

wasn't, helpful, friendly
