Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the patterns of word removals and the corresponding changes in output. A change in output from the original sentence (which we can assume has a baseline output) indicates a significant impact by the removed words on the model's interpretation or classification of the sentence.

1. **"received"**: The removal of this word in several instances leads to a change in output (e.g., from 0 to -1), suggesting its importance in maintaining the original sentiment or meaning of the sentence. When "received" is removed, along with other combinations of words, the output tends to change, indicating its significance.

2. **"huge"**: This word, when removed, often correlates with a change in output. It seems to play a crucial role in the model's interpretation of the sentence, likely contributing to the overall positive sentiment or specific classification the original sentence had.

3. **"thumbs"**: The presence or absence of "thumbs" in the removed words list also correlates with changes in the model's output. This suggests that it is a key word for the model in determining the sentiment or classification of the sentence.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction appear to be:

received, huge, thumbs
