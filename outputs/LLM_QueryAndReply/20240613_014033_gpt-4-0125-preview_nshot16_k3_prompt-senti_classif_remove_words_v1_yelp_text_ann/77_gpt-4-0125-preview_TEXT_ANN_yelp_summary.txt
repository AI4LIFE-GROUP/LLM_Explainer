Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the instances where the removal of certain words led to a change in output. A change in output, indicated by "-1", suggests that the removed words had a significant impact on the model's interpretation of the sentence's sentiment or meaning. By examining the dataset, we can identify which words, when removed, consistently result in a change in output.

1. **Salsa**: The word "salsa" appears in almost all instances where the change in output is "-1". Its frequent removal correlates with a negative change, indicating its high importance in the model's evaluation of the sentence.

2. **Really**: The word "really" is also present in several instances leading to a change in output. Its removal, especially when combined with other key words, seems to affect the model's perception, suggesting it plays a significant role in emphasizing the positive sentiment of the original sentence.

3. **Very**: Similar to "really", "very" is an intensifier that, when removed, especially in conjunction with other important words, leads to a change in output. This indicates its role in modifying the sentiment perceived by the model.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction are:

salsa, really, very
