Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we need to analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output from 0 to -1 indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction, suggesting that the removed words are crucial for the model to maintain its original output.

1. **Flavor**: The removal of "flavor" in several instances leads to a change in output from 0 to -1, indicating its importance. For example, when "it lacked flavor, seemed, and dry." is removed, the output changes to -1, highlighting the significance of "flavor" in the model's prediction.

2. **Seemed**: The word "seemed" also appears to play a significant role. However, its removal does not consistently lead to a change in output as directly as "flavor" does. It's included in combinations where its removal, along with others, changes the output to -1, suggesting its importance but to a lesser degree than "flavor".

3. **Undercooked**: Similar to "flavor", the removal of "undercooked" in combinations leads to a change in output to -1 in several instances. This indicates that "undercooked" is a key word for the model's prediction, especially in the context of the sentence related to food quality.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

flavor, undercooked, seemed
