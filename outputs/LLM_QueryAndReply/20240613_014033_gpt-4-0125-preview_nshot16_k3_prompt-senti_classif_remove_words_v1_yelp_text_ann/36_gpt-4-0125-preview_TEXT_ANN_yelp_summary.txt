Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output based on the words removed. A change in output from the original sentence to a different value (e.g., from 0 to -1) indicates that the removed words had a significant impact on the model's interpretation or sentiment analysis of the sentence.

1. **"real disappointment"** - Whenever these two words are removed together, there is a consistent change in output to -1, indicating a negative sentiment or a significant shift in the model's interpretation. This suggests that these words are crucial for the model to understand the negative sentiment of the original sentence.

2. **"was our waiter"** - The removal of this phrase sometimes leads to a change in output and other times does not. However, its removal alongside "real disappointment" consistently results in a change, suggesting that while it may not be as critical as "real disappointment," it still plays a role in the model's output. Specifically, when "was our waiter" is removed without removing "real disappointment," the change is not as consistent, indicating that its importance is secondary to the sentiment conveyed by "real disappointment."

3. **"the"** - The removal of "the" alone or in conjunction with less impactful words does not change the output, suggesting it has little to no impact on the model's interpretation of sentiment in this context. Its presence or absence does not alter the model's output, indicating it is not among the top important words for determining the model's prediction in this dataset.

Given this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their impact on the change in output, are:

real, disappointment, waiter
