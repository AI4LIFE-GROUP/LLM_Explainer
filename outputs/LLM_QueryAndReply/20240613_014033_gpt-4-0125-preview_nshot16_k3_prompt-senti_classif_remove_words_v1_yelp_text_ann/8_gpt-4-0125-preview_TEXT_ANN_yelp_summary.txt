Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words in influencing the model's prediction, we can analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed. A change in output from 1 to 0 or vice versa indicates a significant impact on the model's prediction. By examining the dataset, we notice patterns that highlight the importance of certain words:

1. **"never"** - Its removal in various combinations consistently leads to a change in the model's output, indicating its strong influence on the prediction.

2. **"go"** - Similar to "never," removing "go" from the sentence often results in a change in output, suggesting its importance in the model's decision-making process.

3. **"back"** - The removal of "back" in different contexts also leads to changes in output, although it seems slightly less impactful compared to "never" and "go" based on the frequency and context of changes.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction, based on their influence on changing the output, are:

never, go, back
