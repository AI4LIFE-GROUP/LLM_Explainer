Question: "Based on the above set, estimate the change in output for the final change in input. What are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Provide the estimated change in output immediately as a single integer on the first line of your response. Do not provide any further details on the first line. Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Based on the dataset, it appears that the change in output is always 0, regardless of the changes in input features. Therefore, we can estimate that the change in output for the final change in input will also be 0.

As for the importance of the features, it's difficult to determine from the given dataset because the output does not change regardless of the input. However, if we had to rank them, we could do so based on the magnitude of their changes.
