Question: "Based on the above set, estimate the change in output for the final change in input. What are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Provide the estimated change in output immediately as a single integer on the first line of your response. Do not provide any further details on the first line. Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas.

Based on the given dataset, it can be observed that when the values of 'A' are high and 'C' is negative, the output tends to be 0. Conversely, when the values of 'A' are low and 'C' is positive, the output tends to be 1. The values of 'B' and 'D' also seem to influence the output, but their impact is less clear. Therefore, the estimated change in output for the final change in input is 1.
A, C, B, D
