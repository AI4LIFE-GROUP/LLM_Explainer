Question: "Based on the above set, estimate the change in output for the final change in input. What are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Provide the estimated change in output immediately as a single integer on the first line of your response. Do not provide any further details on the first line. Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas.

Based on the dataset, the change in output is consistently 0 regardless of the changes in input features. This suggests that the changes in features 'A' through 'D' do not have a significant impact on the output. 

However, if we were to rank the features based on their absolute changes, 'A' generally has the highest change, followed by 'D', 'B', and 'C'. 

A, D, B, C
