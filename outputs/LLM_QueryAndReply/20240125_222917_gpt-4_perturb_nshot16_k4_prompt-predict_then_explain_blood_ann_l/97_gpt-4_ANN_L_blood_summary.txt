Question: "Based on the above set, estimate the change in output for the final change in input. What are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Provide the estimated change in output immediately as a single integer on the first line of your response. Do not provide any further details on the first line. Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas.

The change in output seems to be largely independent of the changes in the input features 'A' through 'D'. In all but one instance, the change in output is 0, regardless of the changes in the input features. The only instance where the output changes is when the change in input 'A' is significantly lower than in other instances. However, this is only one instance and may not be representative of a general trend. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the importance of the features based on this dataset alone.

A, B, C, D
