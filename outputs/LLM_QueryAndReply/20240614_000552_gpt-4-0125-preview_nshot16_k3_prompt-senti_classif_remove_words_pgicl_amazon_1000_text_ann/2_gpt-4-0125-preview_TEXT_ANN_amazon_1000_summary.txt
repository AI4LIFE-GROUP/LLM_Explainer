Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the importance of each word ("customer", "service", "was", "terrible") in driving the model's output, we'll analyze the changes in output based on the presence or absence of these words in the sentence.

1. **Terrible**: When "terrible" is removed, the change in output is consistently 0, indicating that its presence or absence does not alter the model's output. This suggests that "terrible" has a neutral impact on the model's decision, likely because the sentiment or meaning conveyed by the sentence is preserved through other words. Importance: 50.

2. **Customer**: The removal of "customer" alone is not explicitly listed, but when removed along with other words (e.g., "customer was"), the change in output is 0. However, when "customer" is part of the entire phrase being removed ("customer service was terrible"), the change in output is -1. This indicates that "customer" contributes to the negative sentiment but is not solely responsible for the change. Importance: 60.

3. **Service**: Similar to "customer", "service" does not have a direct mention of being removed alone. Its removal in combination with other words results in a change of 0 or -1 when part of the entire sentence. This suggests that "service", like "customer", contributes to the sentiment but is not the sole driver. Importance: 60.

4. **Was**: The removal of "was" in combinations (e.g., "was terrible", "customer was") results in a change of 0. This indicates that "was" is not a key driver of the model's output change. Its role is more of a connector and does not carry sentiment weight. Importance: 40.

Based on the analysis, the relative importance of the words in driving the model's output, considering both their presence and absence, is as follows:

1. **Customer and Service**: Both words seem to have a similar level of importance in affecting the model's output. Their removal, especially in combination with the entire sentence, leads to a negative change. However, their individual impact cannot be distinctly quantified from the provided data but is inferred to be more significant than "terrible" and "was".

2. **Terrible**: Even though "terrible" is a strong negative word, its removal does not change the output, suggesting that the model's interpretation of sentiment or meaning is not heavily reliant on this word alone.

3. **Was**: This word has the least impact on the model's output. It acts more as a grammatical structure component than a sentiment driver.

Final rank: customer, service, terrible, was
