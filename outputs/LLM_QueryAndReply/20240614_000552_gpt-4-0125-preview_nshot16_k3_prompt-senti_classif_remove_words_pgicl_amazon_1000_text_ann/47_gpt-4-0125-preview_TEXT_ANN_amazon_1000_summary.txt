Dataset:
```
Original sentence: During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.

Removed words: several different 2 minute calls , i 5 and was in an area had 5
Change in output: 0

Removed words: 2 minute , i experienced 5 and was in an that bars
Change in output: -1

Removed words: several minute calls , i experienced drops and it was in area that had 5 bars .
Change in output: 0

Removed words: during several different 2 minute calls experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars .
Change in output: -1

Removed words: during several minute calls i experienced drops and it was 5 .
Change in output: 0

Removed words: several different 2 minute calls , i experienced 5 drops and it was an area that had 5 bars
Change in output: -1

Removed words: during calls experienced 5 and was an area bars
Change in output: 0

Removed words: different 2 i experienced drops it was an area 5 bars
Change in output: -1

Removed words: minute , i experienced was in an area had
Change in output: 0

Removed words: different 2 minute calls , i experienced 5 and it was an area that had bars .

Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and removals of specific words in relation to the change in output. We'll focus on words that appear multiple times across different removals to identify patterns that might indicate their importance.

1. **"different"** - This word appears in several removals associated with both a change in output of -1 and 0. Its presence or absence does not consistently correlate with a specific change, suggesting its impact is moderate but not critical. Importance: 50

2. **"minute"** - The word "minute" appears in contexts with both unchanged and changed outputs. Like "different," its impact seems moderate because its removal is part of larger phrases that lead to changes in output. Importance: 50. Rank: "different, minute" (They seem equally important based on the information provided.)

3. **"calls"** - "Calls" appears in many removals, and its removal is often associated with a change in output. However, it's difficult to isolate its effect from the context of the entire phrase being removed. Its importance seems slightly higher due to its frequent involvement in changes. Importance: 55. Rank: "calls, different, minute"

4. **"experienced"** - This word is key in several removals that lead to a change in output. Its removal seems to be closely associated with negative changes, indicating a higher importance in driving the output. Importance: 70. Rank: "experienced, calls, different, minute"

5. **"5"** - The number "5" appears in contexts related to both drops and bars, and its removal is often associated with a change in output. Its specific mention seems crucial in understanding the context of the sentence, suggesting a high importance. Importance: 75. Rank: "5, experienced, calls, different, minute"

6. **"drops"** - The word "drops" is directly related to the negative experiences described in the sentence. Its removal consistently correlates with a change in output, highlighting its significance. Importance: 80. Rank: "drops, 5, experienced, calls, different, minute"

7. **"area"** - While "area" is part of the context explaining where the drops occurred, its removal doesn't consistently lead to a change in output. Its importance seems lower than "drops" but still significant. Importance: 60. Rank: "drops, 5, experienced, calls, area, different, minute"

8. **"was"** - The word "was" is grammatical and appears in several removals. Its removal doesn't seem to have a consistent impact on the change in output, suggesting it's less important than content words. Importance: 40. Rank: "drops, 5, experienced, calls, area, different, minute, was"

9. **"in"** - Similar to "was," "in" is a preposition that appears in many removals. Its role is more about sentence structure than content, making it less critical in driving the output. Importance: 40. Rank: "drops, 5, experienced, calls, area, different, minute, was, in"

Given the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, based on their impact and frequency of involvement in changes to the output, are:

drops, 5, experienced
