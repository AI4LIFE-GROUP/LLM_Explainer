Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence "Unreliable - I'm giving up." We'll consider how the removal of each word or set of words affects the model's output, focusing on both the presence and absence of changes.

1. **Unreliable**: The removal of "unreliable" in various combinations leads to changes in output in multiple instances, both when it's removed alone and when it's removed with other words. Its removal sometimes leads to a change in output (-1) and sometimes does not, indicating its significant role in determining the output. Importance: 90

2. **Giving**: The removal of "giving" alone does not change the output, but when removed with other words, it's part of combinations that lead to both changes and no changes in output. This suggests that "giving" has a moderate influence on the output, but its importance is less than "unreliable" because its direct removal doesn't alter the output. Importance: 60

3. **Up**: The removal of "up" alone does not change the output, and it appears less frequently in combinations that change the output compared to "unreliable" and "giving." This suggests "up" has a lower importance in determining the output than "unreliable" and "giving." Importance: 50

4. **I'm (I, 'm)**: The removal of "I'm" or its parts ("I", "'m") in various combinations leads to changes in output in several instances. The presence or absence of "I'm" seems to have a notable impact on the output, indicating a significant role in determining the output, similar to "unreliable." Importance: 85

5. **- (dash)**: The dash seems to play a critical role in the output change when removed, both alone and in combination with other words. Its removal leads to a change in output in several instances, suggesting a high importance. However, its role appears slightly less critical than "unreliable" but more so than "giving" and "up." Importance: 80

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, considering both their presence and absence, are:

**Unreliable, I'm, -**
