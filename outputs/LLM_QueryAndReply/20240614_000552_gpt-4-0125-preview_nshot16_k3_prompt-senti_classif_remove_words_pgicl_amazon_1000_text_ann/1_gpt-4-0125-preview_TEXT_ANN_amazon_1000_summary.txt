Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. The words in question are "terrible," "product," "waste," "of," "money," and "and." We'll consider how their removal individually or in combinations affects the model's output.

1. **Terrible**: The removal of "terrible" in various combinations shows a consistent pattern where its absence doesn't always lead to a negative output change. For instance, removing "terrible" alone or with other words sometimes results in a 0 change, indicating a neutral impact. However, when "terrible" is part of a combination that leads to a -1 change, it suggests its presence contributes to a negative sentiment. Given the mixed results, its importance is moderate but significant due to its role in negative expressions. Importance: 70

2. **Product**: The word "product" is often removed in combinations that lead to a negative change in output. However, its removal alone doesn't directly result in a change, suggesting it's the context around "product" that drives the sentiment rather than the word itself. Its importance seems secondary to words that more directly influence sentiment. Importance: 50

3. **Waste**: The removal of "waste" in various contexts sometimes leads to no change, but it's also part of combinations that significantly shift the output to negative when removed with certain words. This indicates "waste" has a strong negative connotation but its impact is somewhat context-dependent. Importance: 60

4. **Of**: The word "of" appears in several combinations, but its removal, especially without the context of more emotionally charged words, doesn't significantly alter the output. It acts more as a connector than a sentiment driver. Importance: 30

5. **Money**: Similar to "of," "money" is part of combinations where its removal doesn't consistently lead to a direct change in output. While it can be part of negatively perceived phrases, on its own, it doesn't carry a strong sentiment. Importance: 40

6. **And**: The conjunction "and" is used to connect phrases but doesn't inherently carry sentiment. Its removal, observed in various combinations, doesn't directly influence the output in a consistent manner, indicating its role is more structural within the sentence. Importance: 20

Ranking the words based on their importance in driving the output, considering both their individual and combined impact, we get:

Terrible, Waste, Product, Money, Of, And

Therefore, the top three most important words are:

Terrible, Waste, Product
