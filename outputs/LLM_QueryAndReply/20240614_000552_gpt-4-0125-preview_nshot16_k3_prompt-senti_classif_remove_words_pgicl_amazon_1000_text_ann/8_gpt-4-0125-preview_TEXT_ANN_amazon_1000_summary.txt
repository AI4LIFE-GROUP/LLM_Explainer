Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the importance of each word in driving the output, we'll analyze the changes in output when each word is removed. The key is to observe how consistently the presence or absence of a word correlates with a change in the model's output. 

1. **Has**: Removal of "has" in various combinations leads to both 0 and 1 in output changes. However, when "has" is removed along with other words, it often results in a change to 1, but its removal alone or with "been" does not consistently change the output to 1. This suggests a moderate level of importance. 

2. **Been**: The word "been" seems less pivotal on its own since its removal, especially in combination with "has" or the entire phrase "has been working great," leads to a 0 change, indicating a lower impact on the output change compared to "has."

3. **Working**: The removal of "working" in various combinations (with "has," "great," or alone) shows a consistent pattern of influencing the output to change to 1 or 0, indicating a high level of importance. 

4. **Great**: The removal of "great" shows a mixed influence on the output. When removed with "has working," it leads to a change to 1, but its removal with other words or alone leads to a 0 change, suggesting a moderate to high importance but less so than "working."

5. **. (Period)**: The period's removal alone results in a 0 change, and its removal in combination with other words leads to both 0 and 1 changes. The period seems to have a lower impact on the output change compared to words, indicating its role is more about sentence structure than content.

Based on the analysis, the words can be ranked in terms of their importance in driving the output change as follows:

1. **Working**: Its removal consistently impacts the output, indicating its high importance.
2. **Great**: Shows a significant but slightly less consistent impact than "working."
3. **Has**: While it has an impact, it's more about its combination with other words than its individual presence.
4. **Been**: Less impactful on its own and often seen in combination with "has."
5. **. (Period)**: The least impactful, mostly affecting the structure rather than the semantic content.

Final rank: working, great, has, been, .
