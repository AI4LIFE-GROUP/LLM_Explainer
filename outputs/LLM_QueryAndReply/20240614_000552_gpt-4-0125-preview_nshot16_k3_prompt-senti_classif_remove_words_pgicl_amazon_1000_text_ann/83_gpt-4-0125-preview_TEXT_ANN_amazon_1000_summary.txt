Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the changes in output when each word is removed. A change in output indicates the word's importance in the model's decision-making process. 

1. **don't/don ' t/don**: The variations of "don't" (including "don ' t" and "don") appear frequently in the dataset with different removals leading to changes in output. When "don't" or its variations are removed, especially in combinations that preserve the sentence's negative meaning (e.g., "don ' waste your money"), the output often changes (to -1). This suggests that the presence or absence of "don't" and its variations significantly influences the output. However, the inconsistency in the change (sometimes 0, sometimes -1) when different parts of "don't" are removed makes it a bit complex to rate its importance directly. It seems crucial for maintaining the sentence's negative sentiment but not solely decisive in every format. Importance: 75

2. **waste**: The word "waste" is removed in several instances, and its removal in combination with other words (like "don ' waste your money") often leads to a change in output. However, when "waste" is removed alone or in combinations that significantly alter the sentence structure (like "' waste money"), the change in output is not consistent. This suggests that "waste" contributes to the negative sentiment of the sentence but its importance is somewhat dependent on the context provided by other words. Importance: 65

3. **your**: The removal of "your" alone does not change the output, indicating that while it may contribute to the specificity of the sentiment towards the listener, it does not independently influence the model's output significantly. Its importance seems lower compared to "don't" and "waste" in driving the sentiment. Importance: 30

4. **money**: Similar to "your", the removal of "money" alone results in no change in output. This suggests that "money" is not a key driver of the negative sentiment on its own. However, given the context of the original sentence ("don't waste your money"), it's clear that "money" is a part of the core message. Its importance is likely comparable to "your" but slightly higher due to its direct connection to the negative action of wasting. Importance: 35

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, considering both their presence and absence, are:

don't, waste, money
