Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the importance of each word ("would", "not", "reccommend") in driving the model's output, we'll analyze the changes in output when each word is removed individually or in combination with others. The dataset shows changes in output when different combinations of words are removed from the original sentence "Would not recommend."

1. **"not"**: The removal of "not" consistently leads to a change in output from 0 to -1, regardless of whether other words are removed alongside it. This indicates a strong influence on the model's output, as it directly affects the sentiment of the sentence. The presence of "not" in the original sentence contributes to a negative sentiment, and its removal leads to a significant change in output. Importance: 100

2. **"reccommend"**: The removal of "reccommend" alone does not change the output (0), indicating that its presence or absence, without considering the context provided by other words like "not", does not significantly influence the model's output. However, when removed alongside "not", the output changes, suggesting its role is contextual rather than direct. Importance: 50

3. **"would"**: The removal of "would" alone or in combination with other words does not change the output (0), indicating that it has the least influence on the model's output among the three words. Its role seems to be more about sentence structure than affecting sentiment directly. Importance: 25

Based on the analysis, the words rank in terms of their importance in driving the model's output as follows:

not, reccommend, would
