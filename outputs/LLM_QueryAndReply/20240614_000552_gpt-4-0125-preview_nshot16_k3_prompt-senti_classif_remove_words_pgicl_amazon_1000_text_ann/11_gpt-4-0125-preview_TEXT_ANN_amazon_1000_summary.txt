Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. We'll focus on words that appear multiple times across different scenarios to assess their influence.

1. **Virgin**: The removal of "virgin" in various combinations leads to both 0 and -1 changes, indicating its removal alone isn't consistently driving the output to change in one direction. Its importance seems moderate because it appears in combinations that lead to both outcomes.

2. **Wireless**: Similar to "virgin," "wireless" appears in multiple removals leading to both 0 and -1 changes. Its impact seems to be on par with "virgin," suggesting a moderate level of importance.

3. **Rocks**: The word "rocks" appears in several removals leading to a -1 change, especially when removed alongside other keywords. Its removal seems to contribute significantly to negative output changes, indicating a higher importance than "virgin" and "wireless."

4. **So**: The removal of "so" in different contexts leads to both 0 and -1 changes. Its presence or absence in combinations doesn't consistently predict the direction of the output change, suggesting a moderate importance.

5. **Does**: Similar to "so," "does" appears in various combinations with both 0 and -1 changes. Its impact seems moderate, as its removal doesn't consistently drive the output in a single direction.

6. **This**: "This" is part of combinations leading to both outcomes. Its role appears to be more about the structure than influencing the sentiment directly, indicating a lower importance compared to others.

7. **Cheap**: "Cheap" appears in combinations that lead to both 0 and -1 changes. However, its removal doesn't consistently result in a negative change, suggesting its importance is moderate but possibly lower than "rocks."

8. **Little**: "Little" is in several combinations leading to both outcomes. Its impact seems moderate, similar to "cheap," but its exact influence is hard to isolate due to its frequent combination with other words.

9. **Phone**: The word "phone" appears in many scenarios leading to both 0 and -1 changes. Its removal, especially when combined with other keywords, seems to have a moderate impact, suggesting its importance is significant but not the highest.

10. **!**: The exclamation mark's removal appears in combinations leading to -1 changes, but its presence alone in a removal doesn't directly correlate with the output change, suggesting its importance is minimal in the context of sentiment or output change.

Based on the analysis, the words that appear most crucial in driving the output, considering both their presence in combinations leading to changes and their frequency across different scenarios, are:

- **Rocks**: Its removal is often associated with a negative change, indicating a strong influence on the output.
- **Phone**: Appears frequently and its removal is part of combinations that lead to both outcomes, suggesting a significant but lesser impact than "rocks."
- **Virgin/Wireless**: Both have a moderate impact, but given their foundational role in the context (brand and service), they are tied in importance.

Final rank from most important to least important: rocks, phone, virgin, wireless
