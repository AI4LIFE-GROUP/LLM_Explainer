Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is also significant in all instances. Therefore, the importance of 'A' can be rated as 80.

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' seems to have a negative correlation with the output in the first instance and a positive correlation in the last three instances. The magnitude of change is not as significant as 'A'. Therefore, the importance of 'B' can be rated as 70. The running rank is AB.

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a negative correlation with the output in the first, second and fourth instances and a positive correlation in the third instance. The magnitude of change is not significant. Therefore, the importance of 'C' can be rated as 40. The running rank is ABC.

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is significant in all instances. Therefore, the importance of 'D' can be rated as 85. The running rank is DAB.

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' seems to have a positive correlation with the output in the first, second and third instances and a negative correlation in the fourth instance.
