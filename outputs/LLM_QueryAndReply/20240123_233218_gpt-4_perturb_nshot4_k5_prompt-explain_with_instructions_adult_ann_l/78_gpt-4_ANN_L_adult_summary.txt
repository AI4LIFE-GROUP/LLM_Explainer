Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is positive in the first instance and negative in the remaining instances. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a positive correlation between 'A' and the output. Importance: 70

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is positive in the first three instances and negative in the last. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a positive correlation between 'B' and the output. Importance: 75. Rank so far: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is negative in the first instance and positive in the remaining instances. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a negative correlation between 'C' and the output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: BAC

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is positive in the first two instances and negative in the last two. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'D' and the output. Importance: 90. Rank so far: DBAC

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is negative in the first and third instances and positive in the second and last. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a weak correlation between 'E' and the output. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DBACE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is positive in the first two instances and negative in the last two. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a positive correlation between 'F' and the output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: DBACFE

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is negative in the first two instances and positive in the last two. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a negative correlation between 'G' and the output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: DBACFEG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is negative in the first, third, and fourth instances and positive in the second. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a negative correlation between 'H' and the output. Importance: 75. Rank so far: DBHACFEG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is positive in the first and third instances and negative in the second and last. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a weak correlation between 'I' and the output. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DBHACFEGI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is negative in the first and fourth instances and positive in the second and third. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a weak correlation between 'J' and the output. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DBHACFEGIJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is negative in the first and second instances and positive in the last two. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a negative correlation between 'K' and the output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: DBHACFEGKIJ

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is negative in the first, second, and fourth instances and positive in the third. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a negative correlation between 'L' and the output. Importance: 75. Rank so far: DBHLACFEGKIJ

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is negative in the first and fourth instances and positive in the second and third. The output is 1 in the first two instances and 0 in the last two. This suggests a weak correlation between 'M' and the output. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DBHLACFEGKIJM

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, B, H, L, A, C, F, E, G, K, I, J, M.
