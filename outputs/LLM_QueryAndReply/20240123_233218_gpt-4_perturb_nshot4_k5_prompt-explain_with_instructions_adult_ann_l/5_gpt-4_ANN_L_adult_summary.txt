Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'A' decreases, the output increases and vice versa. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50

2. Feature 'B': 'B' has a positive correlation with the output. When 'B' increases, the output increases. The correlation is stronger than 'A'. Importance: 60. Running rank: BA

3. Feature 'C': 'C' has a negative correlation with the output. When 'C' decreases, the output increases. The correlation is stronger than 'A' but weaker than 'B'. Importance: 55. Running rank: BCA

4. Feature 'D': 'D' has a strong negative correlation with the output. When 'D' decreases, the output increases. Importance: 70. Running rank: DBCA

5. Feature 'E': 'E' has a weak positive correlation with the output. The correlation is weaker than all the previous features. Importance: 40. Running rank: DBCAE

6. Feature 'F': 'F' has a positive correlation with the output. The correlation is stronger than 'E' but weaker than 'A'. Importance: 45. Running rank: DBCAFE

7. Feature 'G': 'G' has a weak positive correlation with the output. The correlation is weaker than all the previous features. Importance: 35. Running rank: DBCAFEG

8. Feature 'H': 'H' has a weak negative correlation with the output. The correlation is weaker than all the previous features. Importance: 30. Running rank: DBCAFEGH

9. Feature 'I': 'I' has a weak positive correlation with the output. The correlation is weaker than all the previous features. Importance: 25. Running rank: DBCAFEGHI

10. Feature 'J': 'J' has a strong positive correlation with the output. When 'J' increases, the output increases. The correlation is stronger than 'B' but weaker than 'D'. Importance: 65. Running rank: DJBCAFEGHI

11. Feature 'K': 'K' has a weak negative correlation with the output. The correlation is weaker than all the previous features. Importance: 20. Running rank: DJBCAFEGHIK

12. Feature 'L': 'L' has a strong negative correlation with the output. When 'L' decreases, the output increases. The correlation is stronger than 'C' but weaker than 'D'. Importance: 60. Running rank: DLJBCAFEGHIK

13. Feature 'M': 'M' has a weak positive correlation with the output. The correlation is weaker than all the previous features. Importance: 15. Running rank: DLJBCAFEGHIKM

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, L, J, B, C, A, F, E, G, H, I, K, M.
