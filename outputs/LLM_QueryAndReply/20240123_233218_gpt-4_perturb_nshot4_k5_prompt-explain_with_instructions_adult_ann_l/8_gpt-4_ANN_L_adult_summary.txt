Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is negative when the output is 1 and 0. This suggests a negative correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 40

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation with the output. Importance: 70. Current rank: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 50. Current rank: BAC

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation with the output. The magnitude of change is also high. Importance: 80. Current rank: DBAC

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is positive when the output is 1 and 0. This suggests a weak correlation with the output. Importance: 30. Current rank: DBACE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 50. Current rank: DBACFE

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is positive when the output is 1 and 0. This suggests a weak correlation with the output. Importance: 30. Current rank: DBACFEG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBACFEHG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBACFEHGI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is negative when the output is 1 and 0. This suggests a negative correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBACFEHGJI

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is zero when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a weak positive correlation with the output. Importance: 30. Current rank: DBACFEHGJIK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation with the output. The magnitude of change is also high. Importance: 80. Current rank: DLBACFEHGJIK

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is negative when the output is 1 and 0. This suggests a negative correlation with the output. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 40. Current rank: DLBACFEHGJIKM

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, L, B, A, C, F, E, H, G, J, I, K, M.
