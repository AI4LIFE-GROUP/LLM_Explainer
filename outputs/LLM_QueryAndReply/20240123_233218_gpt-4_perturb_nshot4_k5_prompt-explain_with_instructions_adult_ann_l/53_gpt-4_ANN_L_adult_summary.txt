Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is negative when the output is both 1 and 0. This suggests that 'A' may not have a strong correlation with the output. Importance: 30

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'B' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'C' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: BCA

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'D' may have a strong correlation with the output. Importance: 80. Current rank: DBCA

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is both positive and negative when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'E' may not have a strong correlation with the output. Importance: 40. Current rank: DBCEA

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'F' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DBCFEA

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'G' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DBCGFEA

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'H' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DBCGHFEA

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests that 'I' may have a strong correlation with the output. Importance: 70. Current rank: DIBCAGHFEA

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'J' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DIBCJAGHFEA

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'K' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DIBCJKAGHFEA

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'L' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DIBCJKLAGHFEA

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is positive when the output is 1 and both positive and negative when the output is 0. This suggests that 'M' may have a moderate correlation with the output. Importance: 50. Current rank: DIBCJKLMAGHFEA

Final rank: D, I, B, C, J, K, L, M, A, G, H, F, E
