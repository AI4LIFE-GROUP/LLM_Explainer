Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change in 'A' is relatively high in all instances. Importance: 80

2. Feature 'B': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output in the second instance and a negative correlation in the third and fourth instances. The magnitude of change in 'B' is relatively high in the second and third instances. Compared to 'A', 'B' seems less important. New rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output in the first and fourth instances and a negative correlation in the second and third instances. The magnitude of change in 'C' is relatively high in the fourth instance. Compared to 'A' and 'B', 'C' seems more important. New rank: CAB

4. Feature 'D': This feature shows a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change in 'D' is relatively high in all instances. Compared to 'C', 'A', and 'B', 'D' seems more important. New rank: DCAB

5. Feature 'E': This feature shows a negative correlation with the output in the first instance and a positive correlation in the last three instances. The magnitude of change in 'E' is relatively low in all instances. Compared to 'D', 'C', 'A', and 'B', 'E' seems less important. New rank: DCABE
