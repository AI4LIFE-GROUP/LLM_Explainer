Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': This feature has a negative correlation with the output. It decreases in all instances, and the output increases in two instances and decreases in two. Its importance is moderate. Rating: 50.

2. Feature 'B': This feature has a weak correlation with the output. It increases in two instances and decreases in one, with the output increasing in two instances and decreasing in two. Its importance is low. Rating: 20. Running rank: AB.

3. Feature 'C': This feature has a strong positive correlation with the output. It increases in all instances where the output increases and decreases in all instances where the output decreases. Its importance is high. Rating: 80. Running rank: CAB.

4. Feature 'D': This feature has a strong negative correlation with the output. It increases in instances where the output increases and decreases significantly in instances where the output decreases. Its importance is high. Rating: 80. Running rank: DCAB.

5. Feature 'E': This feature has a weak correlation with the output. It increases in one instance where the output decreases and decreases in three instances with mixed output results. Its importance is low. Rating: 20. Running rank: DCABE.

6. Feature 'F': This feature has a weak correlation with the output. It increases in one instance where the output increases and decreases in three instances with mixed output results. Its importance is low. Rating: 20. Running rank: DCABEF.

7. Feature 'G': This feature has a weak correlation with the output. It increases in two instances and decreases in two, with mixed output results. Its importance is low. Rating: 20. Running rank: DCABEFG.

8. Feature 'H': This feature has a moderate positive correlation with the output. It increases in instances where the output increases and decreases in instances where the output decreases. Its importance is moderate. Rating: 50. Running rank: DCAHBEFG.

9. Feature 'I': This feature has a weak negative correlation with the output. It increases in one instance where the output decreases and decreases in three instances with mixed output results. Its importance is low. Rating: 20. Running rank: DCAHBEFGI.

10. Feature 'J': This feature has a weak negative correlation with the output. It decreases in all instances, with mixed output results. Its importance is low. Rating: 20. Running rank: DCAHBEFGIJ.

11. Feature 'K': This feature has a moderate positive correlation with the output. It increases in instances where the output increases and decreases in instances where the output decreases. Its importance is moderate. Rating: 50. Running rank: DCAKHBEFGIJ.

12. Feature 'L': This feature has a weak positive correlation with the output. It increases in instances where the output increases and decreases in one instance where the output decreases. Its importance is low. Rating: 30. Running rank: DCAKHBELFGIJ.

13. Feature 'M': This feature has a moderate negative correlation with the output. It increases in instances where the output increases and decreases in instances where the output decreases. Its importance is moderate. Rating: 50. Running rank: DCAKMHBEFLGIJ.

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, C, A, K, M, H, B, E, F, L, G, I, J.
