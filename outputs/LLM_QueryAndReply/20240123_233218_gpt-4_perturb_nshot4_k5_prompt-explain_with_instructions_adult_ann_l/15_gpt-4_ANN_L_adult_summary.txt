Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In two instances, a decrease in 'A' corresponds to a decrease in output, but in another instance, a very small increase in 'A' corresponds to no change in output. Importance: 40

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' also does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In one instance, a decrease in 'B' corresponds to no change in output, but in another instance, an increase in 'B' corresponds to a decrease in output. Importance: 30. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a more consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase in 'C' corresponds to no change or a decrease in output. Importance: 60. Current rank: C, A, B

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a strong impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'D' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 70. Current rank: D, C, A, B

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In two instances, a decrease in 'E' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output, but in another instance, an increase in 'E' corresponds to a decrease in output. Importance: 40. Current rank: D, C, A, E, B

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'F' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 40. Current rank: D, C, A, E, F, B

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a strong impact on the output. In all instances, a decrease in 'G' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 70. Current rank: D, G, C, A, E, F, B

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'H' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 40. Current rank: D, G, C, A, E, F, H, B

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'I' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 40. Current rank: D, G, C, A, E, F, H, I, B

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'J' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 40. Current rank: D, G, C, A, E, F, H, I, J, B

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' seems to have a strong impact on the output. In all instances, an increase in 'K' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 70. Current rank: D, G, K, C, A, E, F, H, I, J, B

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'L' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 40. Current rank: D, G, K, C, A, E, F, H, I, J, L, B

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In all instances, an increase or decrease in 'M' corresponds to a decrease or no change in output. Importance: 40. Final rank: D, G, K, C, A, E, F, H, I, J, L, M, B

Based on the analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: D, G, K, C, A.
