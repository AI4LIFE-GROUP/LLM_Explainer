Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is also significant. Importance: 70

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' has a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is higher than 'A' in some instances. Importance: 75. Rank after 'A': BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' has a positive correlation with the output in the first instance and a negative correlation in the last three instances. The magnitude of change is significant. Importance: 80. Rank after 'B': CBA

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' has a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is the highest among all features. Importance: 90. Rank after 'C': DCBA

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' has a negative correlation with the output in the first and third instances and a positive correlation in the second and fourth instances. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 60. Rank after 'D': DCBAE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' has a negative correlation with the output in the first instance and a positive correlation in the remaining instances. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 55. Rank after 'E': DCBAEF

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' has a positive correlation with the output in all instances. The magnitude of change is significant. Importance: 85. Rank after 'F': DGCBAEF

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' has a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 50. Rank after 'G': DGCBAEFH

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' has a positive correlation with the output in the first, third and fourth instances and a negative correlation in the second instance. The magnitude of change is significant. Importance: 80. Rank after 'H': DGICBAEFH

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' has a positive correlation with the output in the first, third and fourth instances and a negative correlation in the second instance. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 45. Rank after 'I': DGICBAEFHJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' has a negative correlation with the output in the first instance and a positive correlation in the remaining instances. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 55. Rank after 'J': DGICBAEFHKJ

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' has a positive correlation with the output in the first two instances and a negative correlation in the last two instances. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 50. Rank after 'K': DGICBAEFHKLJ

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' has a positive correlation with the output in the first instance and a negative correlation in the remaining instances. The magnitude of change is less than the previous features. Importance: 55. Rank after 'L': DGICBAEFHKLMJ

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, G, I, C, B, A, E, F, H, K, L, M, J
