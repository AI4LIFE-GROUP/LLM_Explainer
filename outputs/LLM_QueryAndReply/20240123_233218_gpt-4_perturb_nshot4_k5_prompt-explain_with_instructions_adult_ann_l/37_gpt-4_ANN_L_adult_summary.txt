Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. This suggests that 'A' is an important feature. Importance: 70

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. However, the magnitude of change in 'B' is smaller than 'A', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 60. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'C' is similar to 'A', suggesting it might be equally important. Importance: 70. Current rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'D' is larger than 'A', 'B', and 'C', suggesting it might be more important. Importance: 80. Current rank: DACB

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'E' is smaller than 'D', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 65. Current rank: DACEB

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is very small and does not seem to have a strong correlation with the output. Importance: 30. Current rank: DACEFB

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a positive correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a negative correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'G' is smaller than 'D', 'A', 'C', and 'E', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 60. Current rank: DACEFGB

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'H' is smaller than 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E', and 'G', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 55. Current rank: DACEGFHB

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'I' is smaller than 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'G', and 'H', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 50. Current rank: DACEGFHIB

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'J' is smaller than 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'H', and 'I', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 45. Current rank: DACEGFHIBJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'K' is larger than 'D', 'A', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'I', and 'J', suggesting it might be more important. Importance: 75. Current rank: DAKCEGFHIBJ

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'L' is larger than 'D', 'A', 'K', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'B', and 'J', suggesting it might be more important. Importance: 85. Current rank: LDAKCEGFHIBJ

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' seems to have a negative correlation with the output when the output is 0 and a positive correlation when the output is -1. The magnitude of change in 'M' is smaller than 'L', 'D', 'A', 'K', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'B', and 'J', suggesting it might be less important. Importance: 65. Current rank: LDAMKCEGFHIBJ

Based on the analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: L, D, A, M, K.
