Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is negative when the output is 1 and 0. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 40

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is negative for both outputs. The magnitude of change is higher than 'A' when the output is 1. Importance: 50. Current rank: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is negative for both outputs. The magnitude of change is higher than 'B' when the output is 1. Importance: 60. Current rank: CBA

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a strong positive correlation. Importance: 80. Current rank: DCBA

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is positive when the output is 0 and negative when the output is 1. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 45. Current rank: DCBAE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is positive when the output is 1 and negative when the output is 0. This suggests a positive correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 50. Current rank: DCBAEF

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a strong negative correlation. Importance: 70. Current rank: DGCBAEF

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 45. Current rank: DGCBAEFH

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 45. Current rank: DGCBAEFIH

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 45. Current rank: DGCBAEFIHJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 45. Current rank: DGCBAEFIHJK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is negative for both outputs. The magnitude of change is higher than 'K' when the output is 1. Importance: 55. Current rank: DGCBAEFLIHJK

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is negative when the output is 1 and positive when the output is 0. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the magnitude of change is not very high. Importance: 45. Current rank: DGCBAEFLIHJKM

Based on the analysis, the five most important features driving the output are: D, G, C, B, A.
