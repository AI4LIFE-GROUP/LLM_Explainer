Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is negative in all instances, and the output changes from 0 to -1. However, the correlation is not very strong as the change in 'A' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 40

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is mostly positive and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'B' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 35. Rank so far: AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is mostly positive and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'C' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 35. Rank so far: ABC

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is stronger than the previous features as the change in 'D' is more consistent with the change in output. Importance: 60. Rank so far: DABC

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'E' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: DABCE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'F' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: DABCEF

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'G' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: DABCEFG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is stronger than the previous features as the change in 'H' is more consistent with the change in output. Importance: 60. Rank so far: HDABCEFG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is mostly positive and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'I' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 35. Rank so far: HDABCEFGI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'J' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: HDABCEFGIJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is mostly positive and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'K' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 35. Rank so far: HDABCEFGIJK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is mostly positive and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is not very strong as the change in 'L' is not consistent with the change in output. Importance: 35. Rank so far: HDABCEFGIJKL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is both positive and negative, and the output changes from 0 to -1. The correlation is stronger than the previous features as the change in 'M' is more consistent with the change in output. Importance: 60. Rank so far: MHDABCEFGIJKL

Final rank of features from most important to least important: M, H, D, A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, L.
