Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The changes in 'A' do not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. The changes in 'A' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20

2. Feature 'B': The changes in 'B' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': The changes in 'C' are both positive and negative, and the output changes consistently in response. Importance: 80. Current rank: C, AB

4. Feature 'D': The changes in 'D' are both positive and negative, and the output changes consistently in response. Importance: 80. Current rank: CD, AB

5. Feature 'E': The changes in 'E' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABE

6. Feature 'F': The changes in 'F' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEF

7. Feature 'G': The changes in 'G' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEFG

8. Feature 'H': The changes in 'H' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEFGH

9. Feature 'I': The changes in 'I' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEFGHI

10. Feature 'J': The changes in 'J' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEFGHIJ

11. Feature 'K': The changes in 'K' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEFGHIJK

12. Feature 'L': The changes in 'L' are both positive and negative, but the output does not consistently change in response. Importance: 20. Current rank: CD, ABEFGHIJKL

13. Feature 'M': The changes in 'M' are both positive and negative, and the output changes consistently in response. Importance: 80. Current rank: CDM, ABEFGHIJKL

Final rank of features from most important to least important: C, D, M, A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L.
