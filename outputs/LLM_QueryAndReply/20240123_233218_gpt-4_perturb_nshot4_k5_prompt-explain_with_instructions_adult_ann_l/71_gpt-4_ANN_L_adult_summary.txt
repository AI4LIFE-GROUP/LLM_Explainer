Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a mixed effect on the output. In two instances, a decrease in 'A' leads to an increase in output, while in the other two, an increase in 'A' leads to a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' also has a mixed effect on the output. In three instances, a decrease in 'B' leads to an increase in output, while in one instance, an increase in 'B' leads to a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation, slightly stronger than 'A'. Importance: 60. Rank so far: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. In three instances, an increase in 'C' leads to an increase in output, while in one instance, a decrease in 'C' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: CBA

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. In all instances, an increase in 'D' leads to an increase in output, while a decrease in 'D' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 90. Rank so far: DCBA

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' seems to have a weak correlation with the output. In two instances, an increase in 'E' leads to an increase in output, while in the other two, a decrease in 'E' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: DCBAE

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' seems to have a weak correlation with the output. In two instances, an increase in 'F' leads to an increase in output, while in the other two, a decrease in 'F' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: DCBAEF

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a weak negative correlation with the output. In three instances, a decrease in 'G' leads to an increase in output, while in one instance, an increase in 'G' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DCBAGEF

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. In three instances, an increase in 'H' leads to an increase in output, while in one instance, a decrease in 'H' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: DCHBAGEF

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' seems to have a weak correlation with the output. In two instances, an increase in 'I' leads to an increase in output, while in the other two, a decrease in 'I' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 40. Rank so far: DCHBAGEFI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' seems to have a mixed effect on the output. In two instances, a decrease in 'J' leads to an increase in output, while in the other two, an increase in 'J' leads to a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DCHBAGEFIJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' seems to have a weak negative correlation with the output. In three instances, a decrease in 'K' leads to an increase in output, while in one instance, an increase in 'K' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DCHBAGEFIJK

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' seems to have a mixed effect on the output. In two instances, a decrease in 'L' leads to an increase in output, while in the other two, an increase in 'L' leads to a decrease in output. This suggests a negative correlation. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50. Rank so far: DCHBAGEFIJKL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. In three instances, an increase in 'M' leads to an increase in output, while in one instance, a decrease in 'M' leads to a decrease in output. Importance: 70. Rank so far: DCHMBAGEFIJKL

Final rank of features from most important to least important: D, C, H, M, B, A, G, E, F, I, J, K, L
