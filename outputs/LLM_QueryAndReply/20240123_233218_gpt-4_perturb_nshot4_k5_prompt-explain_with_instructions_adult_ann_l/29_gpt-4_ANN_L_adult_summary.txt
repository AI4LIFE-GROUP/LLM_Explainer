Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In the first two instances, an increase in 'A' corresponds to no change in output, while in the last two instances, a decrease in 'A' corresponds to a decrease in output. This suggests a weak positive correlation. Importance: 30

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' also does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In the first instance, a decrease in 'B' corresponds to no change in output, while in the second instance, an increase in 'B' also corresponds to no change in output. In the last two instances, a decrease and an increase in 'B' both correspond to a decrease in output. This suggests no clear correlation. Importance: 20

Rank so far: A, B

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a weak negative correlation with the output. In the first three instances, an increase in 'C' corresponds to no change or a decrease in output, while in the last instance, a decrease in 'C' corresponds to a decrease in output. Importance: 40

Rank so far: C, A, B

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a strong negative correlation with the output. In all instances, a decrease in 'D' corresponds to no change or a decrease in output. Importance: 80

Rank so far: D, C, A, B

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' does not seem to have a consistent impact on the output. In the first two instances, an increase in 'E' corresponds to no change in output, while in the last two instances, an increase and a decrease in 'E' both correspond to a decrease in output. This suggests no clear correlation. Importance: 20

Rank so far: D, C, A, E, B

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' seems to have a weak negative correlation with the output. In the first two instances, an increase in 'F' corresponds to no change in output, while in the last two instances, a decrease in 'F' corresponds to a decrease in output. Importance: 40

Rank so far: D, C, F, A, E, B

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a weak positive correlation with the output.
