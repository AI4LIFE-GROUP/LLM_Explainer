Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' is negative in three instances and positive in one. In the instances where 'A' is negative, the output is also negative twice. This suggests a possible positive correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' is positive in three instances and negative in one. The output is 0 in two instances where 'B' is positive and -1 in the instance where 'B' is negative. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: BA

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' is negative in all instances. The output is 0 in two instances and -1 in two instances. This suggests no clear correlation. Importance: 40. Rank so far: BAC

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' is positive in two instances and negative in two. The output is 0 in two instances where 'D' is positive and -1 in two instances where 'D' is negative. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: DBAC

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' is negative in two instances and positive in two. The output is 0 in two instances where 'E' is negative and -1 in two instances where 'E' is positive. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: EDBAC

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' is negative in two instances and positive in two. The output is 0 in two instances where 'F' is negative and -1 in two instances where 'F' is positive. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: FEDBAC

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' is negative in two instances and positive in two. The output is 0 in one instance where 'G' is negative and -1 in one instance where 'G' is positive. This suggests no clear correlation. Importance: 40. Rank so far: FEDBACG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' is positive in two instances and negative in two. The output is 0 in two instances where 'H' is positive and -1 in two instances where 'H' is negative. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: HFEDBACG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' is positive in two instances and negative in two. The output is 0 in two instances where 'I' is positive and -1 in two instances where 'I' is negative. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: IHFEDBACG

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' is positive in two instances and negative in two. The output is 0 in one instance where 'J' is positive and -1 in one instance where 'J' is negative. This suggests no clear correlation. Importance: 40. Rank so far: IHFEDBACGJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' is positive in one instance and negative in three. The output is 0 in the instance where 'K' is positive and -1 in two instances where 'K' is negative. This suggests a possible positive correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: KIHFEDBACGJ

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' is positive in all instances. The output is 0 in two instances and -1 in two instances. This suggests no clear correlation. Importance: 40. Rank so far: KIHFEDBACGJL

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' is positive in two instances and negative in two. The output is 0 in two instances where 'M' is positive and -1 in two instances where 'M' is negative. This suggests a possible negative correlation. However, the correlation is not consistent across all instances. Importance: 60. Rank so far: MKIHFEDBACGJL

Final rank of features from most important to least important: M, K, I, H, F, E, D, B, A, C, G, J, L.
