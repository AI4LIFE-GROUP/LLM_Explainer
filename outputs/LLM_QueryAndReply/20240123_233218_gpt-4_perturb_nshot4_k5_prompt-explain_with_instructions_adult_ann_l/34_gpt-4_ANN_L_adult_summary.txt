Question: "Based on the above set, what are the five most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."

Analyzing the features:

1. Feature 'A': The change in 'A' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'A' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'A' decreases, the output decreases. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50

2. Feature 'B': The change in 'B' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. When 'B' increases or decreases, the output remains the same. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 40. Current rank: AB

3. Feature 'C': The change in 'C' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'C' decreases, the output decreases. However, the correlation is not very strong. Importance: 50. Current rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D': The change in 'D' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'D' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'D' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is stronger than the previous features. Importance: 60. Current rank: DACB

5. Feature 'E': The change in 'E' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. When 'E' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'E' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is stronger than 'B' but weaker than 'D'. Importance: 55. Current rank: DEACB

6. Feature 'F': The change in 'F' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'F' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'F' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is weaker than the previous features. Importance: 45. Current rank: DEACFB

7. Feature 'G': The change in 'G' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'G' decreases, the output remains the same, and when 'G' increases, the output decreases. The correlation is weaker than the previous features. Importance: 40. Current rank: DEACFBG

8. Feature 'H': The change in 'H' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. When 'H' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'H' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is stronger than 'E'. Importance: 60. Current rank: HDEACFBG

9. Feature 'I': The change in 'I' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. When 'I' increases, the output decreases, and when 'I' decreases, the output remains the same. The correlation is weaker than the previous features. Importance: 35. Current rank: HDEACFBGI

10. Feature 'J': The change in 'J' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'J' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'J' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is weaker than the previous features. Importance: 40. Current rank: HDEACFBGIJ

11. Feature 'K': The change in 'K' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. When 'K' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'K' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is stronger than 'E' but weaker than 'H'. Importance: 58. Current rank: HKDEACFBGIJ

12. Feature 'L': The change in 'L' seems to have a negative correlation with the output. When 'L' increases, the output decreases, and when 'L' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is stronger than 'A' but weaker than 'D'. Importance: 55. Current rank: HKDELACFBGIJ

13. Feature 'M': The change in 'M' seems to have a positive correlation with the output. When 'M' increases, the output remains the same, and when 'M' decreases, the output decreases. The correlation is weaker than the previous features. Importance: 45. Current rank: HKDELACFBGIJM

Final rank of features from most important to least important: H, K, D, E, L, A, C, F, B, G, I, J, M.
