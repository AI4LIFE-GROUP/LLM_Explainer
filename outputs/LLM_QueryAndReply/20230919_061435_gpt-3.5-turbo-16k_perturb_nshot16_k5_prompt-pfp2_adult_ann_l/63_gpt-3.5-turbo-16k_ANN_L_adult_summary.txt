For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative. We will also rate the importance of each feature on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: 0.013, -0.065, -0.048, -0.103, 0.080, 0.195, 0.070, -0.166, -0.137, 0.141, -0.078, 0.049, -0.044, 0.104, -0.039, 0.036
Instances with negative changes in A: 0.119, 0.122, 0.143, 0.068, 0.026, -0.126, 0.244, 0.001, -0.022, -0.212, 0.046, 0.029, -0.060, -0.286, 0.058, 0.103
The change in output is consistently negative when A has a positive change and consistently positive when A has a negative change. This indicates a strong negative correlation between A and the output.

b. Importance rating: 90
Based on the consistent negative correlation between A and the output, we can rate the importance of feature A as 90.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.119, 0.122, 0.143, 0.068, 0.026, -0.126, 0.244, 0.001, -0.022, -0.212, 0.046, 0.029, -0.060, -0.286, 0.058, 0.103
Instances with negative changes in B: 0.122
The change in output is consistently negative when B has a positive change and consistently positive when B has a negative change. This indicates a strong negative correlation between B and the output.

b. Importance rating: 90
Based on the consistent negative correlation between B and the output, we can rate the importance of feature B as 90.
