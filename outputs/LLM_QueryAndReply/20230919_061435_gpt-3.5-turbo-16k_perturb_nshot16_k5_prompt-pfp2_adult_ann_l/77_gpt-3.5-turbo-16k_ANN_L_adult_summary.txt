For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative. We will also rate the importance of each feature on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: 0.160, 0.186, 0.012, 0.066, 0.050, 0.050, -0.028, -0.079, -0.241, 0.080
b. Instances with negative changes in A: -0.126, -0.193, -0.276
The instances with positive changes in A have a mix of positive and negative changes in the output, while the instances with negative changes in A have negative changes in the output. This suggests that positive changes in A do not consistently correlate with positive or negative changes in the output, while negative changes in A tend to correlate with negative changes in the output.

Rating: 50
Explanation: The feature A has a moderate importance in determining the output, as positive changes do not consistently correlate with positive or negative changes in the output, while negative changes tend to correlate with negative changes in the output.

Running rank: A

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.011, -0.161, -0.045, -0.122, -0.014, 0.032, 0.155, 0.247, 0.127, 0.040
b. Instances with negative changes in B: -0.256, -0.156, 0.135, -0.240, -0.003
The instances with positive changes in B have a mix of positive and negative changes in the output, while the instances with negative changes in B have negative changes in the output. This suggests that positive changes in B do not consistently correlate with positive or negative changes in the output, while negative changes in B tend to correlate with negative changes in the output.

Rating: 50
Explanation: Similar to feature A, feature B also has a moderate importance in determining the output, as positive changes do not consistently correlate with positive or negative changes in the output, while negative changes tend to correlate with negative changes in the output.

Running rank: AB

3. Feature C:
a. Instances with positive changes in C: 0.017, -0.034, 0.022, 0.005, 0.109, -0.199, 0.029, -0.053, -0.017, 0.098, 0.230, 0.079, -0.137, -0.105, 0.008, 0.128

The instances with positive changes in F have a mix of positive and negative changes in the output. The instances with negative changes in F also have a mix of positive and negative changes in the output. This suggests that both positive and negative changes in F do not consistently correlate with positive or negative changes in the output.

Rating: 50
Explanation: Feature F has a moderate importance similar to features A and B, as both positive and negative changes do not consistently correlate with positive or negative changes in the output.
