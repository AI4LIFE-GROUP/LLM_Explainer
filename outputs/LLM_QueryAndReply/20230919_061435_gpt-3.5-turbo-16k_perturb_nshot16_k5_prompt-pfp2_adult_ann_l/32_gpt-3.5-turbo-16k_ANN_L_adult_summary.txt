For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: 0.075, 0.011, 0.009, 0.109, 0.038, 0.008, 0.051, 0.012, -0.065
b. Instances with negative changes in A: -0.124, -0.288, -0.058, -0.243, -0.072, -0.349

From the instances, we can observe that when A has positive changes, the output tends to be 0, while when A has negative changes, the output tends to be -1. This suggests that positive changes in A have a positive correlation with the output, while negative changes in A have a negative correlation with the output.

Rating the importance of feature A: Based on the observed correlations, we can rate the importance of feature A as 60 out of 100. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.011, 0.099, -0.114, 0.154, -0.004, 0.264, 0.055, 0.089, 0.017
b. Instances with negative changes in B: -0.178, -0.197, 0.116

When B has positive changes, the output tends to be 0, while when B has negative changes, the output tends to be -1. This indicates that positive changes in B have a positive correlation with the output, while negative changes in B have a negative correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature B to feature A: Both features A and B show similar correlations with the output. Therefore, we can position feature B as equally important as feature A. The running rank is AB.

3. Feature C:
a. Instances with positive changes in C: 0.023, 0.129, -0.060, -0.101, -0.163, -0.111, 0.045, -0.022
b. Instances with negative changes in C: -0.059, -0.125, -0.060, 0.210, 0.010, -0.159

Positive changes in C are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in C are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This suggests that changes in C do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature C to features A and B: Feature C does not show a clear correlation with the output, unlike features A and B. Therefore, we can position feature C as less important than features A and B. The running rank is ABC.

4. Feature D:
a. Instances with positive changes in D: -0.337, -0.282, 0.213, 0.231, -0.321, -0.306, 0.241, -0.269
b. Instances with negative changes in D: 0.023, 0.200, -0.101

Positive changes in D are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in D are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This indicates that changes in D do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature D to features A, B, and C: Similar to feature C, feature D does not show a clear correlation with the output. Therefore, we can position feature D as equally important as feature C. The running rank is ABCD.

5. Feature E:

Comparing the importance of feature E to features A, B, C, and D: Feature E also does not show a clear correlation with the output. Therefore, we can position feature E as equally important as features A, B, C, and D. The running rank is ABCDE.

6. Feature F:
a. Instances with positive changes in F: -0.172, -0.350, -0.164, -0.061, -0.004, 0.050, 0.112, -0.257, -0.105
b. Instances with negative changes in F: 0.038, 0.086, 0.056, 0.013, 0.078, -0.030, -0.060, -0.091

Positive changes in F are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in F are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This indicates that changes in F do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature F to features A, B, C, D, and E: Feature F does not show a clear correlation with the output, similar to the previous features. Therefore, we can position feature F as equally important as features A, B, C, D, and E. The running rank is ABCDEF.

7. Feature G:
a. Instances with positive changes in G: 0.009, -0.124, 0.119, -0.048, -0.076, 0.011, -0.089, 0.066
b. Instances with negative changes in G: 0.009, -0.124, -0.076, -0.048, -0.089, 0.011, 0.087, 0.066

Positive changes in G are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in G are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This suggests that changes in G do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature G to features A, B, C, D, E, and F: Feature G does not show a clear correlation with the output, similar to the previous features. Therefore, we can position feature G as equally important as features A, B, C, D, E, and F. The running rank is ABCDEFG.

8. Feature H:

Positive changes in H are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in H are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This indicates that changes in H do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature H to features A, B, C, D, E, F, and G: Feature H does not show a clear correlation with the output, similar to the previous features. Therefore, we can position feature H as equally important as features A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The running rank is ABCDEFGH.

9. Feature I:
a. Instances with positive changes in I: 0.022, 0.082, -0.066, 0.136, -0.042, -0.067, 0.090, 0.085, 0.176, -0.102
b. Instances with negative changes in I: 0.022, 0.082, -0.066, 0.136, -0.042, -0.067, 0.090, 0.085, 0.176, -0.102

Positive changes in I are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in I are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This suggests that changes in I do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature I to features A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H: Feature I does not show a clear correlation with the output, similar to the previous features. Therefore, we can position feature I as equally important as features A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The running rank is ABCDEFGHI.

10. Feature J:

b. Instances with negative changes in L: 0.116, 0.086, -0.160, 0.056, 0.013, 0.078, -0.030, -0.060, -0.091, -0.031, 0.017

Positive changes in L are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in L are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This indicates that changes in L do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature L to features A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K: Feature L does not show a clear correlation with the output, similar to the previous features. Therefore, we can position feature L as equally important as features A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. The running rank is ABCDEFGHIJKL.

13. Feature M:
a. Instances with positive changes in M: -0.147, -0.054, -0.005, -0.079, -0.171, 0.068, 0.015, -0.139, -0.012, -0.012, 0.185
b. Instances with negative changes in M: -0.147, -0.054, -0.005, -0.079, -0.171, 0.068, 0.015, -0.139, -0.012, -0.012, 0.185

Positive changes in M are associated with both 0 and -1 outputs, while negative changes in M are also associated with both 0 and -1 outputs. This suggests that changes in M do not have a strong correlation with the output.

Comparing the importance of feature M to features A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L: Feature M does not show a clear correlation with the output, similar to the previous features. Therefore, we can position feature M as equally important as features A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. The running rank is ABCDEFGHIJKLM.

Final rank of features from 'A' to 'M': ABCDEFGHIJKLM
