For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, we will compare instances where the changes in each feature are positive to instances where the changes are negative. We will also consider the magnitude of the changes in each feature.

1. Analyzing feature 'A':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'A' (e.g., -0.067, 0.001, 0.054) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Instances with negative changes in feature 'A' (e.g., -0.147, -0.110, -0.254) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'A' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. Based on the mixed effects observed, we can rate the importance of feature 'A' as moderate (around 50) in determining the output. The positive and negative correlations cancel each other out, resulting in a relatively neutral impact.

2. Analyzing feature 'B':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'B' (e.g., 0.008, -0.013, 0.023) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'B' (e.g., -0.008, -0.060, -0.074) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Therefore, the change in feature 'B' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. Similar to feature 'A', the importance of feature 'B' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

3. Analyzing feature 'C':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'C' (e.g., 0.008, 0.249, 0.161) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'C' (e.g., -0.159, 0.117, -0.197) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'C' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'C' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

4. Analyzing feature 'D':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'D' (e.g., -0.354, 0.228, 0.259) consistently result in a change of 0 in the output. Instances with negative changes in feature 'D' (e.g., -0.276, 0.333, -0.244) also consistently result in a change of 0 in the output. Therefore, the change in feature 'D' does not have a significant correlation with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'D' can be rated as low (around 25) in determining the output.

5. Analyzing feature 'E':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'E' (e.g., 0.086, 0.078, -0.025) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'E' (e.g., -0.045, 0.026, 0.001) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'E' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'E' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

6. Analyzing feature 'F':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'F' (e.g., 0.019, 0.057, -0.051) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'F' (e.g., 0.053, -0.085, -0.174) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'F' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'F' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

7. Analyzing feature 'G':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'G' (e.g., 0.097, 0.018, 0.284) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'G' (e.g., 0.018, -0.074, -0.125) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'G' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'G' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

8. Analyzing feature 'H':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'H' (e.g., -0.055, 0.084, 0.035) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'H' (e.g., 0.084, -0.223, 0.192) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'H' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'H' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

9. Analyzing feature 'I':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'I' (e.g., 0.133, -0.083, -0.027) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'I' (e.g., 0.111, -0.111, -0.069) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'I' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'I' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

10. Analyzing feature 'J':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'J' (e.g., 0.158, -0.029, 0.072) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'J' (e.g., -0.029, 0.072, -0.094) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'J' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'J' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

11. Analyzing feature 'K':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'K' (e.g., 0.142, -0.074, -0.008) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'K' (e.g., -0.074, -0.192, 0.071) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'K' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'K' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.

12. Analyzing feature 'L':
a. Instances with positive changes in feature 'L' (e.g., 0.045, -0.159, 0.044) have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in no change (0) and others resulting in a change of -1. Instances with negative changes in feature 'L' (e.g., -0.159, -0.010, -0.074) also have mixed effects on the output, with some instances resulting in a change of -1 and others resulting in no change (0). Therefore, the change in feature 'L' does not consistently correlate with the change in output.
b. The importance of feature 'L' can be rated as moderate (around 50) in determining the output.
