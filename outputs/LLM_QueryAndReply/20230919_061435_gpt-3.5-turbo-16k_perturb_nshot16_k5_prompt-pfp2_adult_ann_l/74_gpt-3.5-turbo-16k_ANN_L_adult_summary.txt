For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature from 'A' to 'M' and compare instances where its changes are positive to instances where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances with positive changes in A: -0.049, 0.024, 0.093, 0.062, 0.129, 0.042, 0.094
Instances with negative changes in A: -0.101, -0.035, -0.181, -0.120, -0.111, -0.208, -0.066, -0.184, -0.198

From the dataset, it seems that when A has positive changes, the output tends to be positive (0), while negative changes in A tend to result in a negative output (-1). This suggests a strong correlation between positive changes in A and positive output, and negative changes in A and negative output.

b. Importance rating: 80
Based on the observed correlation, we can rate the importance of feature A as 80 out of 100. It appears to have a significant influence on the model's output.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances with positive changes in B: 0.058, 0.109, 0.098, 0.109, 0.046, 0.092, 0.021, -0.103, -0.027, -0.008
Instances with negative changes in B: -0.144, -0.037, -0.144

Positive changes in B do not consistently correlate with a specific output change. However, negative changes in B tend to result in a negative output (-1). This suggests a weak correlation between negative changes in B and negative output.

b. Importance rating: 40
