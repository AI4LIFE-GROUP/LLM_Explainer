For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, we will compare instances where the changes in each feature are positive to instances where the changes are negative. We will also consider the magnitude of the changes in each feature.

1. Analyzing feature 'A':
a. Instances with positive changes in 'A': 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.027, B: -0.015, C: -0.047, D: 0.220, E: 0.045, F: 0.042, G: 0.064, H: 0.037, I: -0.081, J: 0.030, K: -0.068, L: 0.171, M: 0.017 
   - Change in Output: 0

   Instances with negative changes in 'A':
   - Change in Input: A: -0.040, B: 0.022, C: 0.039, D: -0.349, E: 0.002, F: -0.033, G: 0.040, H: 0.102, I: 0.155, J: -0.064, K: 0.101, L: 0.052, M: -0.044 
   - Change in Output: -1

   The instances with positive changes in 'A' have a change in output of 0, while the instances with negative changes in 'A' have a change in output of -1. This suggests that positive changes in 'A' are associated with no change in output, while negative changes in 'A' are associated with a decrease in output.

b. Rating the importance of feature 'A':
   Based on the analysis, we can rate the importance of feature 'A' in determining the output as 60. This rating considers both positive and negative correlations, giving equal emphasis to both. The positive changes in 'A' have no effect on the output, while the negative changes have a negative correlation with the output.

2. Analyzing feature 'B':
a. Instances with positive changes in 'B':
   - Change in Input: A: 0.099, B: 0.045, C: -0.126, D: -0.333, E: 0.079, F: -0.062, G: -0.076, H: 0.142, I: 0.029, J: 0.098, K: 0.017, L: 0.094, M: 0.074

   - Change in Output: -1

   Both instances with positive and negative changes in 'B' have a change in output of -1. This suggests that both positive and negative changes in 'B' are associated with a decrease in output.

b. Rating the importance of feature 'B':
   Based on the analysis, we can rate the importance of feature 'B' in determining the output as 50. Both positive and negative changes in 'B' have a negative correlation with the output.

Continuing this process for the remaining features, we can analyze and rate their importance:

   - Change in Output: -1

   The instances with positive changes in 'C' have a change in output of 0, while the instances with negative changes in 'C' have a change in output of -1. This suggests that positive changes in 'C' are associated with no change in output, while negative changes in 'C' are associated with a decrease in output.

b. Rating the importance of feature 'C':
   Based on the analysis, we can rate the importance of feature 'C' in determining the output as 60. Positive changes in 'C' have no effect on the output, while negative changes have a negative correlation with the output.

Continuing this process for the remaining features, we can analyze and rate their importance:

   - Change in Output: 0

   The instances with positive changes in 'D' have a change in output of -1, while the instances with negative changes in 'D' have a change in output of 0. This suggests that positive changes in 'D' are associated with a decrease in output, while negative changes in 'D' are associated with no change in output.

b. Rating the importance of feature 'D':
   Based on the analysis, we can rate the importance of feature 'D' in determining the output as 50. Positive changes in 'D' have a negative correlation with the output, while negative changes have no correlation with the output.
