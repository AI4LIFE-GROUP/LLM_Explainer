For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where A has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.380, B: -0.185, C: -0.026, D: 0.065 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.277, B: -0.144, C: -0.157, D: -0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.331, B: -0.052, C: -0.165, D: -0.002 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.341, B: -0.003, C: -0.160, D: -0.081 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.290, B: -0.114, C: -0.143, D: -0.078 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.273, B: 0.058, C: -0.206, D: -0.090 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.259, B: -0.061, C: -0.217, D: -0.079 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: -0.048, C: -0.114, D: -0.091 

   Instances where A has negative changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.395, B: 0.114, C: 0.045, D: -0.104 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.406, B: 0.098, C: -0.099, D: -0.044 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.251, B: 0.023, C: 0.241, D: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.242, B: 0.085, C: 0.302, D: 0.118 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.347, B: 0.110, C: 0.036, D: -0.071 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.304, B: 0.010, C: 0.172, D: 0.085 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.325, B: -0.110, C: 0.234, D: 0.219 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.294, B: 0.061, C: 0.154, D: 0.021 

   From the instances above, we can observe that when A has positive changes, the Change in Output is consistently -1. On the other hand, when A has negative changes, the Change in Output is consistently 0. This indicates a strong negative correlation between the change in A and the output.

b. Rating the importance of feature A: 
Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature A as 90 out of 100. The consistent negative correlation suggests that changes in feature A strongly influence the model's output.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where B has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.380, B: -0.185, C: -0.026, D: 0.065 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.277, B: -0.144, C: -0.157, D: -0.061 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.331, B: -0.052, C: -0.165, D: -0.002 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.273, B: 0.058, C: -0.206, D: -0.090 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: -0.048, C: -0.114, D: -0.091 

   Instances where B has negative changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.395, B: 0.114, C: 0.045, D: -0.104 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.406, B: 0.098, C: -0.099, D: -0.044 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.251, B: 0.023, C: 0.241, D: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.242, B: 0.085, C: 0.302, D: 0.118 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.347, B: 0.110, C: 0.036, D: -0.071 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.304, B: 0.010, C: 0.172, D: 0.085

   - Change in Input: A: -0.294, B: 0.061, C: 0.154, D: 0.021 

   Similar to feature A, when B has positive changes, the Change in Output is consistently -1. However, when B has negative changes, the Change in Output is not consistent. This suggests that the correlation between the change in B and the output is weaker compared to feature A.

b. Rating the importance of feature B: 
Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature B as 70 out of 100. While positive changes in B have a consistent negative correlation with the output, the negative changes in B do not have a strong correlation.

3. Feature C:
a. Instances where C has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.251, B: 0.023, C: 0.241, D: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.347, B: 0.110, C: 0.036, D: -0.071 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.304, B: 0.010, C: 0.172, D: 0.085 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.325, B: -0.110, C: 0.234, D: 0.219 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.294, B: 0.061, C: 0.154, D: 0.021 

   Instances where C has negative changes:

   - Change in Input: A: 0.331, B: -0.052, C: -0.165, D: -0.002 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.273, B: 0.058, C: -0.206, D: -0.090 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.375, B: -0.048, C: -0.114, D: -0.091 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.341, B: -0.003, C: -0.160, D: -0.081 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.259, B: -0.061, C: -0.217, D: -0.079 

   From the instances above, we can observe that when C has positive changes, the Change in Output is consistently 0. On the other hand, when C has negative changes, the Change in Output is consistently -1. This indicates a strong negative correlation between the change in C and the output.

b. Rating the importance of feature C: 
Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature C as 90 out of 100. The consistent negative correlation suggests that changes in feature C strongly influence the model's output, similar to feature A.

4. Feature D:

   - Change in Input: A: 0.380, B: -0.185, C: -0.026, D: 0.065 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.251, B: 0.023, C: 0.241, D: 0.015 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.347, B: 0.110, C: 0.036, D: -0.071 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.242, B: 0.085, C: 0.302, D: 0.118 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.325, B: -0.110, C: 0.234, D: 0.219 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.294, B: 0.061, C: 0.154, D: 0.021

   - Change in Input: A: -0.406, B: 0.098, C: -0.099, D: -0.044 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.242, B: 0.085, C: 0.302, D: 0.118 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.347, B: 0.110, C: 0.036, D: -0.071 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.304, B: 0.010, C: 0.172, D: 0.085 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.273, B: 0.058, C: -0.206, D: -0.090 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.259, B: -0.061, C: -0.217, D: -0.079

Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature D as 60 out of 100. While positive changes in D have a consistent correlation with the output, the negative changes in D do not have a strong correlation.

Based on the analysis of each feature, the rank of features from highest to lowest importance is: ACBDA
