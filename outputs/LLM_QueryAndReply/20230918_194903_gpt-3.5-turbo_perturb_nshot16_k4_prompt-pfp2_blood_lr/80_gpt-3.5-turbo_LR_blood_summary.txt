For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where the change in feature A is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.307, B: 0.026, C: -0.107, D: -0.071
   - Change in Input: A: 0.364, B: -0.024, C: 0.103, D: -0.174
   - Change in Input: A: 0.319, B: -0.060, C: -0.063, D: 0.039
   - Change in Input: A: 0.301, B: 0.064, C: -0.119, D: -0.056
   - Change in Input: A: 0.276, B: 0.059, C: -0.159, D: -0.028
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.057, C: -0.023, D: -0.099
   - Change in Input: A: 0.362, B: 0.140, C: -0.036, D: -0.129

b. Instances where the change in feature A is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.298, B: 0.002, C: 0.172, D: 0.038
   - Change in Input: A: -0.295, B: -0.023, C: 0.159, D: -0.008
   - Change in Input: A: -0.332, B: -0.074, C: 0.114, D: -0.080
   - Change in Input: A: -0.322, B: 0.044, C: 0.074, D: 0.122
   - Change in Input: A: -0.318, B: 0.026, C: 0.104, D: -0.089
   - Change in Input: A: -0.392, B: 0.110, C: -0.084, D: -0.042
   - Change in Input: A: -0.371, B: 0.188, C: 0.128, D: -0.160
   - Change in Input: A: -0.329, B: 0.037, C: 0.084, D: -0.055

From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature A is positive, the change in output is consistently -1. On the other hand, when the change in feature A is negative, the change in output is consistently 0. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the change in feature A and the change in output.

To rate the importance of feature A in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a score on a scale of 0-100. Since both positive and negative correlations are equally important, we can assign a score of 50 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature A in determining the output is 50.

2. Rank: A

Moving on to the next feature:

1. Feature B:
a. Instances where the change in feature B is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.307, B: 0.026, C: -0.107, D: -0.071
   - Change in Input: A: -0.295, B: -0.023, C: 0.159, D: -0.008
   - Change in Input: A: 0.319, B: -0.060, C: -0.063, D: 0.039
   - Change in Input: A: -0.322, B: 0.044, C: 0.074, D: 0.122
   - Change in Input: A: -0.318, B: 0.026, C: 0.104, D: -0.089
   - Change in Input: A: 0.301, B: 0.064, C: -0.119, D: -0.056
   - Change in Input: A: 0.362, B: 0.140, C: -0.036, D: -0.129

b. Instances where the change in feature B is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.364, B: -0.024, C: 0.103, D: -0.174
   - Change in Input: A: -0.298, B: 0.002, C: 0.172, D: 0.038
   - Change in Input: A: -0.332, B: -0.074, C: 0.114, D: -0.080
   - Change in Input: A: 0.233, B: 0.018, C: -0.280, D: -0.093
   - Change in Input: A: -0.392, B: 0.110, C: -0.084, D: -0.042
   - Change in Input: A: -0.371, B: 0.188, C: 0.128, D: -0.160
   - Change in Input: A: 0.308, B: -0.057, C: -0.023, D: -0.099
   - Change in Input: A: -0.329, B: 0.037, C: 0.084, D: -0.055

From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature B is positive, the change in output is a mix of -1 and 0. Similarly, when the change in feature B is negative, the change in output is also a mix of -1 and 0. This indicates that the change in feature B does not have a strong correlation with the change in output.

To rate the importance of feature B in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a lower score on a scale of 0-100. Since the correlations are not as strong as in feature A, we can assign a score of 30 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature B in determining the output is 30.

2. Rank: AB

Moving on to the next feature:

1. Feature C:
a. Instances where the change in feature C is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.298, B: 0.002, C: 0.172, D: 0.038
   - Change in Input: A: -0.295, B: -0.023, C: 0.159, D: -0.008
   - Change in Input: A: -0.332, B: -0.074, C: 0.114, D: -0.080
   - Change in Input: A: -0.322, B: 0.044, C: 0.074, D: 0.122
   - Change in Input: A: -0.318, B: 0.026, C: 0.104, D: -0.089
   - Change in Input: A: -0.392, B: 0.110, C: -0.084, D: -0.042
   - Change in Input: A: -0.371, B: 0.188, C: 0.128, D: -0.160
   - Change in Input: A: -0.329, B: 0.037, C: 0.084, D: -0.055

b. Instances where the change in feature C is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.307, B: 0.026, C: -0.107, D: -0.071
   - Change in Input: A: 0.364, B: -0.024, C: 0.103, D: -0.174
   - Change in Input: A: 0.319, B: -0.060, C: -0.063, D: 0.039

   - Change in Input: A: 0.362, B: 0.140, C: -0.036, D: -0.129

From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature C is positive, the change in output is a mix of 0 and -1. Similarly, when the change in feature C is negative, the change in output is also a mix of 0 and -1. This indicates that the change in feature C does not have a strong correlation with the change in output.

To rate the importance of feature C in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a lower score on a scale of 0-100. Since the correlations are not as strong as in feature A, we can assign a score of 30 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature C in determining the output is 30.

2. Rank: ABC

   - Change in Input: A: 0.362, B: 0.140, C: -0.036, D: -0.129

From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature D is positive, the change in output is a mix of 0 and -1. Similarly, when the change in feature D is negative, the change in output is also a mix of 0 and -1. This indicates that the change in feature D does not have a strong correlation with the change in output.

To rate the importance of feature D in determining the output, considering both positive and negative correlations, we can assign a lower score on a scale of 0-100. Since the correlations are not as strong as in feature A, we can assign a score of 30 to each correlation. Therefore, the importance of feature D in determining the output is 30.
