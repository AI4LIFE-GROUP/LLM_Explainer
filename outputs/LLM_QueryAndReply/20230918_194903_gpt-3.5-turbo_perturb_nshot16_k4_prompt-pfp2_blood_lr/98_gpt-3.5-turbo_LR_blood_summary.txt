For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where the change in feature A is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.335, B: 0.067, C: -0.143, D: -0.006
   - Change in Input: A: 0.309, B: -0.089, C: -0.075, D: -0.165
   - Change in Input: A: 0.290, B: 0.024, C: -0.207, D: -0.058
   - Change in Input: A: 0.334, B: -0.159, C: -0.111, D: -0.009
   - Change in Input: A: 0.340, B: 0.042, C: -0.089, D: -0.067

   Instances where the change in feature A is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.226, B: 0.150, C: 0.358, D: -0.067
   - Change in Input: A: -0.339, B: 0.275, C: -0.094, D: 0.119
   - Change in Input: A: -0.313, B: 0.044, C: 0.029, D: 0.204
   - Change in Input: A: -0.365, B: -0.010, C: 0.011, D: 0.124
   - Change in Input: A: -0.311, B: 0.047, C: 0.092, D: -0.016
   - Change in Input: A: -0.289, B: 0.050, C: 0.213, D: -0.127
   - Change in Input: A: -0.370, B: 0.149, C: 0.045, D: 0.088
   - Change in Input: A: -0.302, B: 0.037, C: 0.121, D: 0.043

   From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature A is positive, the change in output is predominantly 0. On the other hand, when the change in feature A is negative, the change in output is predominantly 1. This suggests a positive correlation between a negative change in feature A and an increase in the output.

b. Rating the importance of feature A: 
Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature A in determining the output as 70 out of 100. This rating indicates that feature A has a relatively high importance in determining the output.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where the change in feature B is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.335, B: 0.067, C: -0.143, D: -0.006
   - Change in Input: A: -0.226, B: 0.150, C: 0.358, D: -0.067
   - Change in Input: A: -0.339, B: 0.275, C: -0.094, D: 0.119
   - Change in Input: A: 0.290, B: 0.024, C: -0.207, D: -0.058
   - Change in Input: A: -0.365, B: -0.010, C: 0.011, D: 0.124
   - Change in Input: A: -0.311, B: 0.047, C: 0.092, D: -0.016
   - Change in Input: A: -0.289, B: 0.050, C: 0.213, D: -0.127
   - Change in Input: A: -0.370, B: 0.149, C: 0.045, D: 0.088

   Instances where the change in feature B is negative:
   - Change in Input: A: 0.309, B: -0.089, C: -0.075, D: -0.165
   - Change in Input: A: -0.313, B: 0.044, C: 0.029, D: 0.204
   - Change in Input: A: 0.334, B: -0.159, C: -0.111, D: -0.009
   - Change in Input: A: 0.340, B: 0.042, C: -0.089, D: -0.067
   - Change in Input: A: 0.298, B: 0.111, C: -0.244, D: 0.135

   - Change in Input: A: 0.283, B: 0.094, C: -0.212, D: -0.042

   From the instances above, we can observe that there is no clear correlation between the change in feature B and the change in output. The instances where the change in feature B is positive and negative have both resulted in a mix of 0 and 1 in the change in output.

b. Rating the importance of feature B:
Considering the lack of a clear correlation, we can rate the importance of feature B in determining the output as 50 out of 100. This rating indicates that feature B has a moderate importance in determining the output.

3. Feature C:
a. Instances where the change in feature C is positive:
   - Change in Input: A: -0.226, B: 0.150, C: 0.358, D: -0.067
   - Change in Input: A: -0.313, B: 0.044, C: 0.029, D: 0.204

   - Change in Input: A: 0.309, B: -0.089, C: -0.075, D: -0.165
   - Change in Input: A: 0.290, B: 0.024, C: -0.207, D: -0.058
   - Change in Input: A: 0.334, B: -0.159, C: -0.111, D: -0.009
   - Change in Input: A: 0.340, B: 0.042, C: -0.089, D: -0.067
   - Change in Input: A: 0.298, B: 0.111, C: -0.244, D: 0.135
   - Change in Input: A: 0.364, B: 0.065, C: -0.185, D: -0.042
   - Change in Input: A: 0.302, B: 0.037, C: 0.121, D: 0.043

   From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature C is positive, the change in output is predominantly 1. On the other hand, when the change in feature C is negative, the change in output is predominantly 0. This suggests a positive correlation between a positive change in feature C and an increase in the output.

b. Rating the importance of feature C:
Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature C in determining the output as 70 out of 100. This rating indicates that feature C has a relatively high importance in determining the output.

4. Feature D:

   - Change in Input: A: -0.339, B: 0.275, C: -0.094, D: 0.119

   From the instances above, we can observe that when the change in feature D is positive, the change in output is predominantly 1. On the other hand, when the change in feature D is negative, the change in output is predominantly 0. This suggests a positive correlation between a positive change in feature D and an increase in the output.

b. Rating the importance of feature D:
Considering both positive and negative correlations, we can rate the importance of feature D in determining the output as 70 out of 100. This rating indicates that feature D has a relatively high importance in determining the output.

Based on the analysis of each feature, the running rank of feature importance is as follows: C > D > A > B.

The final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' is CADB.
