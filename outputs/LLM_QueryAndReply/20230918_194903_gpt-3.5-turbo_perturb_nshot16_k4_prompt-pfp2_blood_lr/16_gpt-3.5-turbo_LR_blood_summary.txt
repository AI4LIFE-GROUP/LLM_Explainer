For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'D':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'D' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'D' on the last line.

REPLY:
To analyze the influence of each feature on the model's output, let's go through each feature one by one and compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative.

1. Feature A:
a. Instances where A has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.284, B: -0.042, C: -0.165, D: -0.103 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.292, B: 0.045, C: -0.124, D: -0.102 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.272, B: -0.069, C: -0.121, D: -0.239 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.311, B: 0.077, C: -0.198, D: -0.041 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.198, B: -0.164, C: -0.304, D: 0.034 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.288, B: -0.002, C: -0.090, D: -0.067 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.332, B: 0.055, C: -0.044, D: -0.058 
   
   Instances where A has negative changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.317, B: 0.048, C: 0.134, D: 0.125 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.234, B: 0.138, C: 0.230, D: 0.137 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.321, B: -0.091, C: 0.141, D: -0.026 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.375, B: 0.151, C: -0.041, D: 0.023 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.322, B: 0.064, C: 0.075, D: -0.030 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.305, B: 0.008, C: 0.140, D: 0.121 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.413, B: -0.096, C: 0.022, D: 0.004 
   - Change in Input: A: -0.264, B: 0.020, C: 0.221, D: 0.144 

   From the given dataset, it seems that the change in feature A does not have a consistent correlation with the change in output. There are instances where both positive and negative changes in A result in a change in output, and instances where they do not.

b. Rating the importance of feature A: 
Considering both positive and negative correlations, and giving equal emphasis to both, it is difficult to determine the importance of feature A in determining the output. Therefore, we can assign a moderate importance rating of 50 to feature A.

2. Feature B:
a. Instances where B has positive changes: 
   - Change in Input: A: 0.292, B: 0.045, C: -0.124, D: -0.102
