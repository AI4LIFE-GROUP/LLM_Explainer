Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the importance of each word in driving the output, we'll analyze how the removal of each word (or words) affects the change in output. A change in output from the original sentence ("Crust is not good.") indicates the word's influence. A change to 1 suggests a positive sentiment or a negation of the original negative sentiment, while a change to 0 suggests a neutral or unchanged sentiment from the original negative sentiment.

1. **Crust**: Removal of "crust" in various combinations leads to both 0 and 1 changes in output. However, when "crust" is removed alone, the output changes to 0, indicating that its presence contributes to the negative sentiment but is not solely responsible for it. Its influence is moderate because it needs to be combined with other words to change the output significantly.

2. **Is**: The removal of "is" in combinations where the output changes to 1 suggests that it plays a role in maintaining the sentence's structure but does not carry sentiment by itself. Its removal alongside sentiment-carrying words like "good" or "not good" leads to a positive change, indicating its role is more structural than sentiment-driven.

3. **Not**: The removal of "not" leads to a change to 0, indicating a significant shift towards a neutral or positive sentiment by negating the negation. This suggests "not" is crucial in driving the negative sentiment of the original sentence.

4. **Good**: The removal of "good" consistently results in a change to 1, indicating a significant positive shift in sentiment. This suggests that "good" is a key driver of sentiment in the original sentence, and its removal negates the negative sentiment implied by "not good."

Based on the analysis:

- **Good** has the most significant impact on changing the output, indicating its crucial role in the sentiment of the sentence. Its removal leads to a positive change, suggesting it's the primary driver of the negative sentiment.
- **Not** also plays a critical role, as its removal shifts the sentiment towards neutral or positive, indicating its importance in forming the negative sentiment.
- **Crust** has a moderate influence. Its removal alone makes the sentence neutral, suggesting it contributes to the context but is not a strong sentiment driver.
- **Is** seems to have the least impact on sentiment directly. Its role is more about sentence structure than sentiment, and its removal, especially without "good" or "not," doesn't significantly change the sentiment.

Final rank: good, not, crust, is
