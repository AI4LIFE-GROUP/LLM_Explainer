Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the changes in output based on the presence or absence of specific words. The key is to identify patterns where the removal of certain words consistently leads to a change in output, either from 0 to -1 or vice versa. 

1. **Flavor**: The removal of "flavor" in several instances leads to no change in output (0), but its presence in combinations that result in a change suggests its importance might not be as high as others that directly flip the output when removed alone. Its influence seems moderate.

2. **Lacked**: The word "lacked" appears in multiple instances where its removal leads to a change in output. Particularly, its removal alongside other words often results in a -1 output, indicating its significant role in the negative sentiment of the sentence. Its importance is high due to its consistent presence in changes.

3. **Seemed**: The removal of "seemed" in various combinations does not consistently affect the output change directly unless removed with other key words. Its role appears less critical on its own, suggesting a lower importance.

4. **Undercooked**: Similar to "seemed", "undercooked" does not consistently drive the output change on its own. Its removal, combined with other words, affects the output, but it's not as pivotal as "lacked" or "dry".

5. **Dry**: The word "dry" stands out as its removal, especially in combinations, often leads to a neutral or unchanged output (0). Its presence in sentences that lead to a negative output (-1) when removed highlights its critical role in driving the negative sentiment of the original sentence. Its importance is very high.

6. **And**: The conjunction "and" is removed in various instances, but its removal or presence doesn't directly correlate with a consistent change in output. Its role is more about sentence structure than sentiment, indicating lower importance in driving output.

7. **, (Comma)**: The removal of commas shows no direct influence on the output change, indicating the least importance in sentiment analysis. Its role is purely structural.

Based on the analysis, the words can be ranked in terms of their importance in driving the output change as follows:

1. **Lacked**: Its removal alongside other words consistently leads to a negative output, indicating a strong influence on the sentiment.
2. **Dry**: Critical in driving the negative sentiment, its removal changes the output significantly.
3. **Flavor**: While not as directly influential as "lacked" or "dry", its presence in negative sentences suggests moderate importance.
4. **Seemed**: Less critical on its own and often requires the removal of other words to change the output.
5. **Undercooked**: Similar to "seemed", it doesn't directly drive output changes on its own.
6. **And**: More structural than influential in sentiment.
7. **, (Comma)**: Least important, purely structural with no direct impact on sentiment.

Final rank: lacked, dry, flavor, seemed, undercooked, and, ,
