Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. The dataset shows changes in output when certain words are removed from the original sentence. A change in output of "-1" indicates a negative impact, while "0" indicates no change. 

1. **helpful**: The removal of "helpful" consistently leads to a negative change in output in multiple instances. This suggests that "helpful" is crucial for maintaining a positive or neutral sentiment in the model's output. Its importance is high because its absence directly correlates with a negative shift.

2. **friendly**: Similar to "helpful," "friendly" also appears to be significant. Its removal in various combinations leads to a negative change in output, indicating its positive contribution to the sentiment of the original sentence. 

3. **rarely**: The word "rarely" seems to have a mixed impact. In some cases, its removal does not change the output, but in combinations where "helpful" or "friendly" are also removed, its absence contributes to a negative change. This suggests that "rarely" might amplify the negative sentiment when combined with the absence of positive descriptors.

4. **checked**: The removal of "checked" in different combinations does not consistently lead to a change in output. However, its presence in combinations that result in a negative change suggests it plays a role, albeit less significant than "helpful" or "friendly."

5. **waiter**: The word "waiter" is removed in several instances, leading to both negative changes and no change in output. Its role seems more related to the context rather than directly influencing the sentiment.

6. **on**: The removal of "on" alone does not change the output, indicating its low significance in affecting the model's sentiment analysis.

7. **us**: Similar to "on," the removal of "us" does not consistently impact the output, suggesting its low importance.

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words in descending order of importance are:

helpful, friendly, rarely
