Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the changes in output when specific words are removed from the original sentence. The original sentence is "Worst food/service I've had in a while." and the changes in output are either 0 (no change) or -1 (negative change). The negative change suggests a decrease in the sentiment score, indicating the removed word(s) had a significant impact on the sentiment conveyed by the sentence.

1. **Worst**: Every instance where "worst" is removed, the change in output is -1. This indicates a strong negative sentiment associated with this word, and its removal consistently leads to a decrease in the negative sentiment score of the sentence. Importance: 100

2. **Food/Service**: Removal of "food/service" along with other words sometimes results in no change (0), but never independently shows a change of -1 when removed by itself. This suggests that while "food/service" is contextually important, it does not drive the sentiment change as strongly as "worst" does. Importance: 50

3. **I've/I 've/I**: The variations of "I've" or "I" being removed show no change (0) in output, indicating that these words do not significantly impact the sentiment score by themselves. Importance: 10

4. **Had**: Removal of "had" in various combinations does not show a direct impact on the output change when considered alone. Importance: 10

5. **In**: Similar to "had", "in" does not show a direct impact on the output change when considered alone. Importance: 10

6. **A**: The word "a" being removed does not directly influence the output change on its own. Importance: 10

7. **While**: The removal of "while" shows no change (0) in output, indicating it has little to no impact on the sentiment score by itself. Importance: 10

Given the analysis, the ranking of words based on their importance in driving the output, from most important to least important, is:

Worst, Food/Service, I've/I 've/I, Had, In, A, While
