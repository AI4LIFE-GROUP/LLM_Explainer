Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word removal on the change in output. We'll focus on words that, when removed, lead to a consistent change in output, indicating their importance in the original sentence's sentiment or meaning as interpreted by the model.

1. **Disappointed**: This word is removed in several instances, and its removal often correlates with a change in output. Notably, when "disappointed" is removed, the change in output is not consistent, indicating its presence or absence significantly influences the model's output. Its importance is high because it directly relates to the sentiment of the sentence. **Importance: 90**

2. **But**: The word "but" is removed in a few instances, and its removal sometimes leads to a change in output. This suggests that "but" plays a role in contrasting or changing the direction of the sentence, which can be crucial for understanding the overall sentiment or meaning. However, its impact is less consistent compared to "disappointed." **Importance: 70**

3. **Deeply**: This word modifies "disappointed," intensifying the sentiment. Its removal in some cases leads to a change in output, but like "but," its impact is less direct on the sentiment compared to "disappointed." Its role is significant but secondary to the key sentiment word. **Importance: 60**

4. **Give**: The word "give" is part of the action in the sentence but does not directly influence the sentiment. Its removal leads to a change in output in some cases, but this seems more related to the sentence structure than the sentiment itself. **Importance: 50**

5. **Try**: Similar to "give," "try" is part of the action and intent of the original sentence. Its removal impacts the output, but again, this seems more structural than sentiment-driven. **Importance: 40**

6. **Swung**, **In**, **To**, **Them**, **A**, **Was**: These words are primarily functional and contribute to the sentence structure. Their removal does affect the output in some cases, but their importance is more about sentence coherence than directly influencing sentiment or meaning. **Importance: 20-30**

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, considering both their positive and negative impact on the model's interpretation of sentiment or meaning, are:

Disappointed, But, Deeply
