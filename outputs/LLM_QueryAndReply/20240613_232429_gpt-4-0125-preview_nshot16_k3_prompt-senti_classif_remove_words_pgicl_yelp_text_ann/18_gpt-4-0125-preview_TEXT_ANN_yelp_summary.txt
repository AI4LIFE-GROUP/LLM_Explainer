Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences and the impact of each word's removal on the change in output. The dataset indicates changes in output when specific words are removed, with a change of -1 suggesting a significant impact on the model's output when the word(s) is removed, and a change of 0 indicating no impact. 

1. **Disgusted**: This word appears in several instances where its removal leads to a change in output. Notably, when "disgusted" is removed along with other words, the output often changes (-1 in several cases). However, there are also instances where its removal, directly or indirectly, does not change the output (0 in a few cases). This suggests a moderate level of importance. 

2. **Hair**: The removal of "hair" alone does not change the output (0), but in combinations where "hair" is removed with other words, we see both changes and no changes in output. This indicates that "hair" has a contextual importance that is significant in combination but not alone. 

3. **Sure**: The word "sure" appears in multiple combinations where its removal leads to a change in output (-1). This suggests that "sure" is a key word in determining the output, especially when considered in conjunction with words that express certainty or affirmation.

4. **Because**: The removal of "because" in various combinations leads to both changes and no changes in output. This suggests that "because" has a contextual importance, contributing to the model's understanding of causality within the sentence.

5. **Pretty**: The word "pretty" appears in combinations where its removal does not significantly change the output (0 in most cases), indicating a lower importance relative to other words.

6. **Human**: Similar to "hair," "human" is part of combinations that lead to both changes and no changes in output. Its specific contribution seems to be more context-dependent, suggesting a moderate level of importance.

7. **Was**: Despite its frequent appearance, the removal of "was" in various combinations leads to both changes and no changes in output. This indicates that while "was" is structurally important, its impact on the output is highly context-dependent.

8. **I**: The pronoun "I" appears frequently, but its removal leads to a mix of outcomes. This suggests that while "I" is central to the sentence's subject, its impact on the output is variable.

9. **That**: The word "that" is part of combinations leading to both changes and no changes in output, suggesting a moderate level of importance, primarily in structuring the sentence.

Given the analysis, the top three most important words in determining the output, considering both their individual and contextual impacts, are:

**Sure, Disgusted, Hair**
