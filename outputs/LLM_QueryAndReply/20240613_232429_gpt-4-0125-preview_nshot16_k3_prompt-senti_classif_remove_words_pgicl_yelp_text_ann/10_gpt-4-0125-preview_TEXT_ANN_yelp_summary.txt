Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences of each word in the dataset and their impact on the change in output. We'll focus on words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, indicating their importance in the original sentence's meaning or sentiment.

1. **Pancake**: The word "pancake" is removed in several instances, but its removal alone does not always lead to a change in output (e.g., "Change in output: 0" when only "pancake" is removed). However, when combined with other words, its removal can lead to a negative change. This suggests that while "pancake" is contextually relevant, it's not the strongest driver of output change on its own. Importance: 40

2. **Large**: The removal of "large" or phrases including "large" often results in a negative change in output (-1). This indicates a strong correlation between the presence of "large" and the positive sentiment of the original sentence. Importance: 80

3. **Good**: The word "good" is directly associated with the sentence's positive sentiment. Its removal in different combinations does not always change the output, but considering the positive nature of the word, it's likely crucial for the positive output. Importance: 70

4. **Also**: The removal of "also" in various combinations does not consistently affect the output. It seems to have a neutral effect, suggesting it's not a critical driver of sentiment in the sentence. Importance: 30

5. **Really**: Similar to "also," "really" is used to intensify the adjective it modifies ("really good"), but its removal doesn't consistently affect the output. This suggests it enhances the sentiment but is not crucial on its own. Importance: 50

6. **At that**: The phrase "at that" is part of larger phrases whose removal leads to a change in output. However, it seems more like a phrase that completes the sentence rather than driving its sentiment. Importance: 20

7. **Was**: The word "was" is part of the sentence structure but does not carry sentiment on its own. Its removal in various combinations shows it's not a key driver of sentiment change. Importance: 10

8. **And**: This conjunction links parts of the sentence but does not itself carry sentiment. Its removal, combined with other words, does affect the output, but it's not a primary driver. Importance: 25

9. **Pretty**: The word "pretty" is used as an intensifier similar to "really," but its specific removal isn't highlighted as changing the output directly. Given its role, it likely supports positive sentiment but isn't a primary driver. Importance: 60

10. **That**: The word "that" is used in the dataset in phrases whose removal changes the output. However, it seems to function more as part of a phrase rather than a key sentiment driver. Importance: 15

Based on the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, considering both their presence and absence, are:

**Large, Good, Pretty**
