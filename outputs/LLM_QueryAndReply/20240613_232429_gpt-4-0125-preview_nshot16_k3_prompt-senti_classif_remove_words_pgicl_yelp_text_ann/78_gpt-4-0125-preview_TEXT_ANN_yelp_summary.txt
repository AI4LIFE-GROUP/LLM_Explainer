Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the top three most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the occurrences of specific words in the dataset where their removal leads to a change in output. We'll focus on the words that appear in the "Removed words" list in scenarios where the "Change in output" shifts from 0 to -1 or vice versa. 

1. **Order**: Appears in multiple instances where its removal correlates with a change in output. It's a key component of the sentence, indicating the action of placing an order, which is central to the customer's experience. Its removal often leads to a negative change, suggesting its high importance in maintaining the sentence's original sentiment or meaning.

2. **Minutes**: This word is closely associated with the waiting times mentioned in the sentence, which are crucial details in the customer's narrative. Its removal appears in both scenarios where the output changes and where it doesn't, indicating its importance but also showing that its impact might be context-dependent.

3. **Food**: The word "food" is central to the context of the sentence, which is about a dining experience. Its removal is directly linked to changes in output in several instances, highlighting its significance in conveying the essence of the customer's complaint.

4. **Waiting**: This word encapsulates the customer's dissatisfaction, directly relating to the negative aspect of the experience. Its removal in certain instances leads to a change in output, underscoring its importance in driving the sentiment of the sentence.

5. **Arrived**: Related to the culmination of the waiting experience, its removal is seen in instances leading to a change in output. However, its impact seems less direct compared to words like "order" or "food," which are more central to the customer's complaint.

6. **But**: While "but" is a conjunction that might seem less significant at first glance, its role in contrasting the initial expectation with the eventual disappointment is crucial. However, its removal doesn't consistently lead to a change in output, suggesting its importance is more about sentence structure than content.

7. **Fast**: This word describes the initial service speed, and its removal is noted in several changes in output. However, its importance seems secondary to the core issues of waiting and service delivery mentioned in the sentence.

8. **Sitting**: Related to the initial part of the customer experience, its removal is noted but seems to have a less direct impact on the change in output compared to words directly related to the service issues.

9. **Got**: As a verb indicating receipt or experience, its removal is noted but its impact on the output change seems less direct, making it less crucial in the context of the specific customer complaint.

10. **Fairly**: Modifies "fast," providing nuance to the service speed. Its removal is noted but its impact seems minimal in the context of the overall sentiment of the sentence.

Based on the analysis, considering both the frequency of appearance in scenarios with output changes and the contextual importance of the words, the top three most important words driving the output are:

**Order, Food, Waiting**
