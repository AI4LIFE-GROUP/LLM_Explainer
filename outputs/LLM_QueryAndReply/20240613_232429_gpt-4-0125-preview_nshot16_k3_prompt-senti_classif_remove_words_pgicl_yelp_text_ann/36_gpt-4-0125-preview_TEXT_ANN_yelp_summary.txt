Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze each word's presence or absence in the dataset and its impact on the change in output. The key is to identify patterns where the removal of specific words consistently leads to a change in output, particularly focusing on changes from 0 to -1, as these indicate a negative impact on the model's output.

1. **Real**: The removal of "real" in various combinations leads to both 0 and -1 changes. However, it's crucial to note that its removal alongside other key words often results in a -1 change. This suggests that while "real" may contribute to the sentiment, its impact is conditional on the presence of other words. Importance: 60

2. **Disappointment**: The word "disappointment" is central to the negative sentiment of the original sentence. Its removal in combinations consistently results in a -1 change, indicating a significant impact on the model's output. Importance: 90

3. **Was**: The removal of "was" shows no consistent pattern leading to a change in output, suggesting its impact is minimal or dependent on the context provided by other words. Importance: 20

4. **Our**: The removal of "our" alone and in combinations mostly leads to a 0 change, indicating a negligible impact on the model's output. Importance: 10

5. **Waiter**: Similar to "disappointment," the removal of "waiter" in various combinations often results in a -1 change, indicating its significant role in the model's output. However, its importance seems slightly less than "disappointment" because it is more about the subject than the sentiment itself. Importance: 80

6. **The**: The removal of "the" alone and in combinations mostly leads to a 0 change, suggesting it has little to no impact on the model's output. Importance: 5

7. **. (Period)**: The removal of the period alone and in combinations leads to a 0 change, indicating it has no impact on the model's output. Importance: 0

Based on the analysis, the words can be ranked in terms of their importance in driving the model's output from most to least important as follows:

Disappointment, Waiter, Real, Was, Our, The, .
