Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze the presence and absence of each word in the context of changes in output. We'll focus on words that, when removed, consistently lead to a change in output, either from 1 to 0 or vice versa. 

1. **"daily"** - Its removal is involved in both changes to 1 and to 0, but it's not consistent in its effect. It appears in combinations that lead to both outcomes, suggesting its importance is moderate but not decisive on its own. Importance: 50

2. **"specials"** - Similar to "daily," its removal is seen in changes to both 1 and 0. However, its presence and absence are also not solely responsible for the change, indicating a moderate level of importance. Importance: 50. Running rank: daily, specials (equal importance)

3. **"are"** - The word "are" is part of several removals leading to both outcomes. Its effect is not singularly decisive since it's often removed alongside other words. Importance: 50. Running rank: daily, specials, are (equal importance)

4. **"always"** - This word's removal is part of changes leading to both 1 and 0. Like the others, its impact is moderate and context-dependent. Importance: 50. Running rank: daily, specials, are, always (equal importance)

5. **"a"** - The letter "a" appears in contexts leading to both outcomes but is not a strong determinant on its own. Its impact is minimal in isolation. Importance: 30. Running rank: daily, specials, are, always, a

6. **"hit"** - The removal of "hit" leads to a change in output to 1 in one instance, but it's also part of combinations that don't change the output. Its presence seems more crucial than some other words. Importance: 60. Running rank: hit, daily, specials, are, always, a

7. **"with"** - Similar to "hit," its removal is part of scenarios leading to both outcomes. It seems slightly more pivotal in changing the output than some others. Importance: 60. Running rank: hit, with, daily, specials, are, always, a

8. **"my"** - The word "my" is involved in changes to both 1 and 0, but like others, it doesn't show a strong decisive pattern on its own. Importance: 50. Running rank: hit, with, daily, specials, are, always, my, a

9. **"group"** - The removal of "group" leads to a change to 0 in a couple of instances, suggesting its presence is somewhat important for maintaining the original output. Importance: 55. Running rank: hit, with, group, daily, specials, are, always, my, a

10. **"their"** - Its removal leads to a change to 1 in several instances, indicating its absence might be more influential in changing the output than the presence or absence of some other words. Importance: 55. Running rank: hit, with, their, group, daily, specials, are, always, my, a

After analyzing the importance of each word based on their impact on the model's output, the top three most important words, considering both their positive and negative correlations, are:

**hit, with, their**
