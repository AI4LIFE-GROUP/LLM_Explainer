Question: "Based on the above set, what are the top three most important words driving the output?"

Instructions: "

1. Analyze the word in question. Rate the importance of the word in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the word, position it in a running rank compared to the words already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing word 'B', determine its relative importance compared to word 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all words are ranked.

After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the final rank of the words from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
To determine the most important words driving the output, we'll analyze each word's presence or absence in relation to the change in output. A change in output from 1 to 0 or vice versa indicates a significant impact of the removed words on the model's decision-making process. We'll consider both the instances where their removal leads to a change in output and where it does not, to assess their overall importance.

1. **will**: The removal of "will" in various combinations leads to both changes and no changes in output, indicating its influence is context-dependent. However, its presence in multiple instances leading to a change suggests a moderate level of importance. Given the mixed results, its importance is moderate but not the highest. **Importance: 60**

2. **never**: Similar to "will," "never" appears in several combinations that affect the output. Its removal, especially when combined with "will," often leads to a change, highlighting its role in the sentence's sentiment. Like "will," its importance is moderate. **Importance: 60** (Rank so far: will=never)

3. **ever**: The word "ever" appears less frequently in combinations that change the output. Its removal seems to have a less consistent impact on the output change, suggesting it's less critical than "will" and "never." **Importance: 40** (Rank so far: will=never, ever)

4. **go**: "go" is crucial; its removal in different contexts leads to a change in output, indicating a strong influence on the model's interpretation of the sentence. **Importance: 70** (Rank so far: go, will=never, ever)

5. **back**: The removal of "back" in various contexts leads to changes in output, similar to "go." This suggests "back" is also a key word in determining the output. **Importance: 70** (Rank so far: go=back, will=never, ever)

Given the analysis, the top three most important words driving the output, based on their influence on the model's decision-making process, are:

go, back, will=never
