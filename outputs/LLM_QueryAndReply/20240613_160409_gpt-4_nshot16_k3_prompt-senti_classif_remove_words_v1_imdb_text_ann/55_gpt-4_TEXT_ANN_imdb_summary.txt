Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The dataset shows that the removal of any word or combination of words from the original sentence does not change the model's output. This suggests that no single word in the sentence has a significant influence on the model's prediction. However, since we are asked to identify the top three most important words, we can consider the words that carry the most meaning in the sentence. In this case, "filmiing", "less", and "expansive" seem to be the most meaningful words as they provide the most information about the subject, the degree, and the characteristic respectively.

filmiing, less, expansive
