Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order.

REPLY:
The model's prediction seems to change when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. The words that seem to have the most impact are "remake", "originality", and "freshness". When these words are removed, the model's output changes, suggesting that they are important in the model's prediction. 

Answer: remake, originality, freshness
