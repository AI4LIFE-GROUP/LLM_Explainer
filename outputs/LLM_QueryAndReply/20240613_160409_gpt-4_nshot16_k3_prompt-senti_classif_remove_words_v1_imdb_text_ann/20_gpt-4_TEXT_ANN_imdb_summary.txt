Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes every time a word is removed from the original sentence. However, some words seem to have a greater impact on the model's output than others. The words that cause a change in output when removed are likely to be the most important words in determining the model's prediction. 

From the dataset, it appears that the words 'waste', 'your', and 'game' are the most important. Every time one of these words is removed, the model's output changes. This suggests that these words have a significant influence on the model's prediction. 

Answer: waste, your, game
