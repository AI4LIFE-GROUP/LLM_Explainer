Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction changes every time a word is removed from the sentence. This suggests that each word in the sentence contributes to the model's output. However, some words seem to have a greater impact on the model's prediction than others. 

For instance, the word "worst" appears in many of the removed words when the change in output is 1. This suggests that the word "worst" is important in determining the model's prediction. Similarly, the words "sappiest" and "dialogue" also appear frequently in the removed words when the change in output is 1, indicating that these words are also important in determining the model's prediction.

Therefore, based on the frequency of appearance in the removed words when the change in output is 1, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction appear to be "worst", "sappiest", and "dialogue".

worst, sappiest, dialogue
