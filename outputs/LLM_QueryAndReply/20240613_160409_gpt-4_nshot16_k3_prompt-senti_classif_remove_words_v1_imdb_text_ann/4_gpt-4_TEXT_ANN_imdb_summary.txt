Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. By comparing the "Removed words" in the dataset where the "Change in output" is -1, we can identify the words that, when removed, cause a change in the model's output. 

The words that appear most frequently in the "Removed words" when the "Change in output" is -1 are: 'felt', 'like', and 'very'. These words appear in almost all instances where the output changes, suggesting that they are important in determining the model's prediction.

Therefore, the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction, ranked from most important to least important, are:

felt, like, very
