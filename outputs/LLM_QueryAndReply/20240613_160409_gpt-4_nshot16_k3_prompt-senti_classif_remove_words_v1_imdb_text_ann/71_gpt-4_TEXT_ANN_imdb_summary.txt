Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. By analyzing the dataset, we can see that the removal of certain words consistently results in a change in output. 

The word 'think' appears in 7 out of 8 instances where the output changes from the original. Similarly, the word 'film' appears in 6 out of 8 instances where the output changes. The word 'great' also appears in 5 out of 8 instances where the output changes. 

Therefore, based on the frequency of their appearance in instances where the output changes, it can be inferred that 'think', 'film', and 'great' are the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction.

think, film, great
