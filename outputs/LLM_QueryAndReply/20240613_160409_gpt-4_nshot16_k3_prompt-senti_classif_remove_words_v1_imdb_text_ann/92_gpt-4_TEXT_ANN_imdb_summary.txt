Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's output changes when the word "bad" is removed, indicating that it is an important word in determining the model's prediction. The word "story" and "acting" also seem to have an impact on the model's output when removed. However, the word "characters" does not seem to affect the model's output when removed, suggesting it is less important. 

Answer: bad, story, acting
