Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction seem to be those that, when removed, cause a change in the model's output. In this case, the words "and", "did", and "find" appear to be the most important. When these words are removed from the sentence, the model's output changes, suggesting that these words have a significant influence on the model's prediction.

Answer: and, did, find
