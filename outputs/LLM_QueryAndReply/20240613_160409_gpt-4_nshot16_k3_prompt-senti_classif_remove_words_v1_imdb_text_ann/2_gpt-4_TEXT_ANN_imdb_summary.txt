Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction changes every time certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. However, it's difficult to determine the top three most important words without more detailed analysis. We would need to see which words, when removed, consistently cause a change in the model's output. 

However, based on the given dataset, it seems that the words 'spoiler', 'ending', and 'survivors' might be important. These words appear in many of the sentences where their removal causes a change in the model's output. 

spoiler, ending, survivors
