Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction changes every time certain words are removed from the original sentence. By comparing the original sentence with the removed words, we can identify the words that were present in the original sentence but are missing in the removed words list. These missing words are likely the ones that influence the model's prediction. 

From the dataset, it appears that the words 'this', 'and', 'will' are consistently present in the original sentence but missing in the removed words list whenever the model's output changes. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction.

Answer: this, and, will
