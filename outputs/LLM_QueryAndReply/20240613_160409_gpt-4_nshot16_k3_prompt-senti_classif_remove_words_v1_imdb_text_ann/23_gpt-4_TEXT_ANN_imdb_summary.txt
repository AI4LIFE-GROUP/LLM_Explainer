Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The model's prediction changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's output. By comparing the sentences where the output changes (-1) with those where it doesn't (0), we can identify the words that seem to have the most influence on the model's prediction. 

The words "can", "tolerate", and "incorrectness" appear to be the most important. These words are present in all sentences where the output is 0 and are missing in all sentences where the output is -1. This suggests that the presence of these words is crucial for the model to maintain its original prediction.

can, tolerate, incorrectness
