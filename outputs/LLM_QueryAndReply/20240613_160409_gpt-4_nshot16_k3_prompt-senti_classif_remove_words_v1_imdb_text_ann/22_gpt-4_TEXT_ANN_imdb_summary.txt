Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
Reasoning: The model's prediction changes when certain words are removed from the original sentence. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. By comparing the removed words in each case where the output changes, we can identify the common words that seem to have the most influence on the model's prediction. 

The words 'movie', 'intelligence', and 'imagination' appear frequently in the removed words when the output changes. This suggests that these words are important in determining the model's prediction. 

Answer: movie, intelligence, imagination
