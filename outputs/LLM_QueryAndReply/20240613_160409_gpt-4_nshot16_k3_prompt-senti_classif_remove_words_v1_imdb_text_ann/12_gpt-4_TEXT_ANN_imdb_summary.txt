Question: "Based on the model’s predictions and the given dataset, what appears to be the top three most important words in determining the model’s prediction?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top three most important words ranked from most important to least important, in descending order. Only provide the important words on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line. Provide the answer on one line with each word separated by commas."



REPLY:
The most important words in determining the model's prediction can be identified by looking at the changes in output when these words are removed. If the removal of a word causes a change in the model's output, it suggests that the word is important in the model's decision-making process. 

In this dataset, the words 'this', 'movie', and 'so' each cause a change in output of -1 when removed, suggesting that these words are important in the model's prediction. The word 'is' also causes a change in output when removed, but it appears multiple times in the dataset, and its removal does not always result in a change in output. This suggests that 'is' may be less important than 'this', 'movie', and 'so'. 

The words 'awesome' and '!', on the other hand, do not cause any change in output when removed, suggesting that they are not important in the model's prediction.

Based on this analysis, the top three most important words in determining the model's prediction appear to be 'this', 'movie', and 'so'.

this, movie, so
