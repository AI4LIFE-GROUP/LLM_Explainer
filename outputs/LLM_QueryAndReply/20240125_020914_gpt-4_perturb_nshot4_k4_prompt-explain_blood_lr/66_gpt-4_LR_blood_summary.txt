PROMPT_TEXT:
Context: "We have a two-class machine learning model that predicts based on 4 features: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']. The dataset below contains the change in feature values 'A' through 'D' with respect to a given instance and the corresponding change in model outputs."

Dataset:
```

Change in Output: 0

Change in Input: A: -0.267, B: 0.245, C: 0.153, D: -0.018
Change in Output: 0

Question: "Based on the above set, what are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The question asks for the four most important features driving the output. However, based on the dataset provided, it is not possible to determine the importance of the features. This is because the change in output is always 0, regardless of the changes in the input features. This suggests that the output is not sensitive to changes in the input features, or at least not within the range of changes observed in the dataset. Therefore, we cannot rank the features based on their importance in driving the output.

A, B, C, D
