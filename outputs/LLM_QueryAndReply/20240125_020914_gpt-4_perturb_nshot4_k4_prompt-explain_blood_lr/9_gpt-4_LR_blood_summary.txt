PROMPT_TEXT:
Context: "We have a two-class machine learning model that predicts based on 4 features: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']. The dataset below contains the change in feature values 'A' through 'D' with respect to a given instance and the corresponding change in model outputs."

Dataset:
```
Change in Input: A: -0.290, B: 0.080, C: 0.103, D: 0.140
Change in Output: 0

Change in Input: A: -0.312, B: 0.087, C: 0.042, D: 0.073
Change in Output: 0

Change in Input: A: 0.414, B: -0.122, C: 0.116, D: 0.000
Change in Output: 0

Change in Input: A: 0.320, B: -0.101, C: -0.105, D: 0.043

Question: "Based on the above set, what are the four most important features driving the output?"

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer as the top four features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order, separated by commas. Only provide the feature names on the last line. Do not provide any further details on the last line."


REPLY:
The question asks for the most important features driving the output of the model. However, based on the dataset provided, all changes in the input features ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') result in no change in the output (0). This suggests that none of the features 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' have a significant impact on the output, at least based on the given dataset. 

However, if we were to rank the features based on the magnitude of their changes, 'A' tends to have the largest changes, followed by 'C', 'D', and 'B'. But again, it's important to note that these changes do not seem to affect the output based on the provided dataset.

A, C, D, B
