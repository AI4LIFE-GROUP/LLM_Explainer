REPLY:
The most important features driving the output can be determined by looking at the changes in the input features and how they correspond to the changes in the output. 

In the given dataset, we can see that when feature 'A' decreases (from -0.378 to -0.240), the output remains the same. However, when 'A' increases (from -0.240 to 0.377 and then to 0.222), the output decreases. This suggests that 'A' has a negative correlation with the output and is likely an important feature.

Similarly, when 'B' increases (from 0.116 to -0.148), the output decreases. This suggests that 'B' also has a negative correlation with the output and is likely an important feature.

For 'C', when it decreases (from -0.001 to 0.164), the output remains the same. However, when 'C' decreases further (from 0.164 to -0.097 and then to -0.285), the output decreases. This suggests that 'C' has a negative correlation with the output and is likely an important feature.

Finally, for 'D', when it increases (from 0.045 to 0.344), the output remains the same. However, when 'D' decreases (from 0.344 to -0.002 and then to -0.144), the output decreases. This suggests that 'D' has a negative correlation with the output and is likely an important feature.

Based on this analysis, all four features seem to be important in driving the output, with 'A' and 'B' appearing to have a stronger correlation with the output than 'C' and 'D'. 

A, B, C, D
