Question: "Based on the model's predictions and the given dataset, estimate the change in output for the final change in input."

Instructions: "Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning provide your answer as:

a) on the penultimate line, the estimated change in output

b) on the last line, the top five most important features ranked from most important to least important, in descending order.

Only provide the change in output and the feature names on the last two lines. Do not provide any further details on the last two lines."


REPLY:
The change in output is not directly given for the final change in input. However, we can make an educated guess based on the previous changes in input and their corresponding changes in output. It seems that the model's output increases when there are increases in features D, E, F, K, and L, and decreases in features A, I, and M. 

a) 1

b) D, E, F, K, L
