For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0). When 'A' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'A' seems to have a significant influence on the output, especially when it decreases.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output tends to decrease (-1). When 'B' decreases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'B' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to 'A'.

Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'C' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance: 30. 'C' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to 'A' and 'B'.

Rank: ABC

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0). When 'D' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a negative correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'D' seems to have a significant influence on the output, similar to 'A'.

Rank: ADB

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'E' decreases, the output is also mixed (0 and -1). This suggests no clear correlation between 'E' and the output.

Rank: ADBE

6. Feature 'F':
a. When 'F' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0). When 'F' decreases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'F' and the output.

Rank: ADBEF

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'G' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'G' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to 'A' and 'D', but more so than 'E' and 'F'.

Rank: ADBGF

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'H' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests no clear correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance: 20. 'H' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to the other features.

Rank: ADBGFH

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'I' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'I' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to 'A', 'B', 'D', and 'G'.

Rank: ADBGFI

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'J' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'J' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'J' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to 'A', 'B', 'D', 'G', and 'I'.

Rank: ADBGFIJ

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'K' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests no clear correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance: 20. 'K' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to the other features.

Rank: ADBGFIJK

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0). When 'L' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a negative correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'L' seems to have a significant influence on the output, but less so than 'A' and 'D'.

Rank: ADLGBFIJK

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output is mixed (0 and -1). When 'M' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests no clear correlation between 'M' and the output.
b. Importance: 20. 'M' seems to have a less consistent influence on the output compared to the other features.

Final Rank: ADLGBFIJKM
