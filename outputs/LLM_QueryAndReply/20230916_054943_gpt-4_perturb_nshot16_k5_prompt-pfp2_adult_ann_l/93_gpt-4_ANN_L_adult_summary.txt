For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to be 1 (3 out of 5 instances). When 'A' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (6 out of 11 instances). This suggests a positive correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance: 55. It has a moderate influence on the output, but it's not consistent.
Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output is evenly split between 0 and 1. When 'B' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (3 out of 4 instances). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. It has a weaker influence on the output compared to 'A'.
Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to be 1 (5 out of 6 instances). When 'C' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (7 out of 10 instances). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. It has a stronger influence on the output compared to 'A' and 'B'.
Rank: CAB

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output tends to be 1 (7 out of 8 instances). When 'D' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (7 out of 8 instances). This suggests a very strong correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance: 90. It has the strongest influence on the output so far.
Rank: DCAB

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output tends to be 1 (6 out of 8 instances). When 'E' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (5 out of 7 instances). This suggests a moderate positive correlation between 'E' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. It has a stronger influence on the output compared to 'A' and 'B', but weaker than 'C' and 'D'.
Rank: DCEAB

6. Feature 'F':

b. Importance: 55. It has a similar influence on the output as 'A'.
Rank: DCEFAB

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output tends to be 1 (3 out of 4 instances). When 'G' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (7 out of 11 instances). This suggests a moderate positive correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. It has a similar influence on the output as 'E'.
Rank: DCGEFAB

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output tends to be 1 (4 out of 6 instances). When 'H' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (5 out of 7 instances). This suggests a moderate positive correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. It has a similar influence on the output as 'E' and 'G'.
Rank: DCGHEFAB

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output tends to be 1 (6 out of 8 instances). When 'I' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance: 75. It has a stronger influence on the output compared to all features except 'D'.
Rank: DCIGHEFAB

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output tends to be 1 (6 out of 8 instances). When 'J' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (3 out of 4 instances). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'J' and the output.
b. Importance: 75. It has a similar influence on the output as 'I'.
Rank: DCJIGHEFAB

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output tends to be 1 (6 out of 7 instances). When 'K' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance: 80. It has a stronger influence on the output compared to all features except 'D'.
Rank: DCKJIGHEFAB

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output tends to be 1 (3 out of 4 instances). When 'L' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (7 out of 11 instances). This suggests a moderate positive correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. It has a similar influence on the output as 'E', 'G', and 'H'.
Rank: DCKJLIGHEFAB

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output tends to be 1 (3 out of 5 instances). When 'M' decreases, the output tends to be 0 (6 out of 8 instances). This suggests a moderate positive correlation between 'M' and the output.
b. Importance: 55. It has a similar influence on the output as 'A' and 'F'.
