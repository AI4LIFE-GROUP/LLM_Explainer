For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0), and when 'A' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a positive correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'A' seems to have a significant influence on the output, but there are instances where 'A' decreases and the output stays the same, suggesting it's not the only influential feature.
Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output tends to decrease (-1), and when 'B' decreases, the output tends to stay the same (0). This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'B' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but there are instances where 'B' increases and the output stays the same, suggesting other features may also be influential.
Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. There doesn't seem to be a clear correlation between 'C' and the output. Both positive and negative changes in 'C' can lead to either a decrease or no change in the output.
b. Importance: 30. 'C' doesn't seem to have a strong influence on the output.
Rank: BAC

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0), and when 'D' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a positive correlation between 'D' and the output.
