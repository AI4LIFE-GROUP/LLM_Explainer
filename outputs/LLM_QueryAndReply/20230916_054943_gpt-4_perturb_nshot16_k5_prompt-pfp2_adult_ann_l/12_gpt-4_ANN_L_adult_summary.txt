For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to stay the same (0). When 'A' decreases, the output tends to decrease (-1). This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'A' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, as changes in 'A' often correspond to changes in the output.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output is mixed, sometimes staying the same and sometimes decreasing. When 'B' decreases, the output tends to decrease. This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'B' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', as changes in 'B' do not consistently correspond to changes in the output.

Rank: AB

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to stay the same. When 'C' decreases, the output tends to decrease. This suggests a negative correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance: 50. 'C' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but less than 'A'.

Rank: ACB

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output tends to stay the same. When 'D' decreases, the output tends to decrease. This suggests a negative correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'D' seems to have a strong influence on the output, more than 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

Rank: DACB

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output tends to stay the same. When 'E' decreases, the output is mixed. This suggests a weak correlation between 'E' and the output.
b. Importance: 30. 'E' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than the previous features.

Rank: DACEB

6. Feature 'F':
a. When 'F' increases, the output tends to stay the same. When 'F' decreases, the output tends to decrease. This suggests a negative correlation between 'F' and the output.

Rank: DAFCEB

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output is mixed. When 'G' decreases, the output tends to stay the same. This suggests a weak correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance: 30. 'G' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than most of the previous features.

Rank: DAFCEGB

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output tends to decrease. When 'H' decreases, the output tends to stay the same. This suggests a negative correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'H' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'A'.

Rank: DAFHCEGB

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output tends to stay the same. When 'I' decreases, the output is mixed. This suggests a weak correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance: 30. 'I' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than most of the previous features.

Rank: DAFHCEGIB

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output tends to decrease. When 'J' decreases, the output is mixed. This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'J' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'J' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'C', 'F', and 'H'.

Rank: DAFHCEGJIB

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output tends to decrease. When 'K' decreases, the output tends to stay the same. This suggests a negative correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'K' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'A' and 'H'.

Rank: DAFHKCEGJIB

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output tends to stay the same. When 'L' decreases, the output tends to decrease. This suggests a negative correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance: 50. 'L' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'C' and 'F'.

Rank: DAFHKCLCEGJIB

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output tends to decrease. When 'M' decreases, the output tends to stay the same. This suggests a negative correlation between 'M' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'M' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, similar to 'A', 'H', and 'K'.

Final Rank: DAFHKMCLCEGJIB
