For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 7 times), while when 'A' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 9 times). This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance of 'A': 60. It seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but it's not consistent.
Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 7 times), while when 'B' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 9 times). This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance of 'B': 65. It seems to have a slightly stronger influence on the output than 'A'.
Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 8 times), while when 'C' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 8 times). This suggests a strong negative correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance of 'C': 75. It seems to have a stronger influence on the output than both 'A' and 'B'.
Rank: CBA

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 8 times), while when 'D' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (6 out of 8 times). This suggests a very strong negative correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance of 'D': 85. It seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
Rank: DCBA

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 8 times), while when 'E' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 8 times). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'E' and the output.

Rank: DCBAE

6. Feature 'F':
a. When 'F' increases, the output is more likely to decrease (3 out of 4 times), while when 'F' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (7 out of 12 times). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'F' and the output.
b. Importance of 'F': 50. It seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'.
Rank: DCBAEF

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 6 times), while when 'G' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (6 out of 10 times). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance of 'G': 60. It seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'A' and 'E'.
Rank: DCBAGEF

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 7 times), while when 'H' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 9 times). This suggests a strong negative correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance of 'H': 80. It seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'E', 'F', and 'G', but weaker than 'C' and 'D'.
Rank: DHCBAGEF

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 8 times), while when 'I' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 8 times). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance of 'I': 60. It seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'A', 'E', and 'G'.
Rank: DHCBAIGEF

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 6 times), while when 'J' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (6 out of 10 times). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'J' and the output.

Rank: DHCBAIJGEF

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (3 out of 5 times), while when 'K' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (7 out of 11 times). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance of 'K': 60. It seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'A', 'E', 'G', 'I', and 'J'.
Rank: DHCBAIJKGEF

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 7 times), while when 'L' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 9 times). This suggests a moderate negative correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance of 'L': 65. It seems to have a slightly stronger influence on the output than 'A', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'J', and 'K', but weaker than 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'H'.
Rank: DHLCBAIJKGEF

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (1 out of 2 times), while when 'M' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (8 out of 14 times). This suggests a weak negative correlation between 'M' and the output.
