For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output tends to increase (3 out of 5 times). When 'A' decreases, the output tends to decrease (6 out of 8 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'A' seems to have a strong influence on the output, but there are some inconsistencies.

Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output tends to increase (5 out of 7 times). When 'B' decreases, the output tends to decrease (5 out of 6 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance: 75. 'B' seems to have a slightly stronger influence on the output than 'A'.

Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output tends to increase (4 out of 5 times). When 'C' decreases, the output tends to decrease (6 out of 10 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'C' and the output.

Rank: BAC

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output tends to increase (7 out of 8 times). When 'D' decreases, the output tends to decrease (6 out of 7 times). This suggests a strong positive correlation between 'D' and the output.

Rank: DBACFE

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output tends to decrease (4 out of 6 times). When 'G' decreases, the output tends to increase (6 out of 9 times). This suggests a negative correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance: 55. 'G' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'F', but in the opposite direction.

Rank: DBACFEG

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output tends to increase (5 out of 8 times). When 'H' decreases, the output tends to decrease (4 out of 7 times). This suggests a weak positive correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance: 50. 'H' seems to have a weaker influence on the output than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F', and 'G', but stronger than 'E'.

Rank: DBACFEGH

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output tends to decrease (4 out of 6 times). When 'I' decreases, the output tends to increase (6 out of 9 times). This suggests a negative correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance: 55. 'I' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'F' and 'G', but in the opposite direction.

Rank: DBACFEGHI

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output tends to increase (6 out of 8 times). When 'J' decreases, the output tends to decrease (3 out of 7 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'J' and the output.
b. Importance: 60. 'J' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'E', 'H', 'I', but weaker than 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F', and 'G'.

Rank: DBACFEGHIJ

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output tends to increase (2 out of 4 times). When 'K' decreases, the output tends to decrease (6 out of 11 times). This suggests a weak positive correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance: 40. 'K' seems to have the weakest influence on the output so far.

Rank: DBACFEGHIJK

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output tends to increase (7 out of 8 times). When 'L' decreases, the output tends to decrease (3 out of 7 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance: 70. 'L' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'A'.

Rank: DBACFELGHIJK

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output tends to increase (5 out of 6 times). When 'M' decreases, the output tends to decrease (5 out of 9 times). This suggests a positive correlation between 'M' and the output.
b. Importance: 55. 'M' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'F', 'G', and 'I'.

Final Rank: DBACFELGHIJMK
