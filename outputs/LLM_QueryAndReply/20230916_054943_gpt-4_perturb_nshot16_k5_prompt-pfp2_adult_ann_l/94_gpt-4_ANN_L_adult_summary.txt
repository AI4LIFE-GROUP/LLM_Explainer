For each feature, starting with 'A' and continuing to 'M':

1. Analyze the feature in question:
a. Compare instances where its changes are positive to where its changes are negative and explain how this difference correlates with the change in output.
b. Rate the importance of the feature in determining the output on a scale of 0-100, considering both positive and negative correlations. Ensure to give equal emphasis to both positive and negative correlations and avoid focusing only on absolute values.

2. After analyzing the feature, position it in a running rank compared to the features already analyzed. For instance, after analyzing feature 'B', determine its relative importance compared to 'A' and position it accordingly in the rank (e.g., BA or AB). Continue this process until all features from 'A' to 'M' are ranked.

Upon completion of all analyses, provide the final rank of features from 'A' to 'M' on the last line.

Avoid providing general methodologies or suggesting tools. Justify your findings as you go.


REPLY:
1. Feature 'A':
a. When 'A' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (3 out of 5 instances). When 'A' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 6 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'A' and the output.
b. Importance of 'A': 60. This is because 'A' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but it's not consistent across all instances.
Rank: A

2. Feature 'B':
a. When 'B' increases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 7 instances). When 'B' decreases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'B' and the output.
b. Importance of 'B': 70. 'B' seems to have a stronger influence on the output than 'A', and it's more consistent across instances.
Rank: BA

3. Feature 'C':
a. When 'C' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 7 instances). When 'C' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'C' and the output.
b. Importance of 'C': 75. 'C' seems to have a slightly stronger influence on the output than 'B', and it's also more consistent across instances.
Rank: CBA

4. Feature 'D':
a. When 'D' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 7 instances). When 'D' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (6 out of 9 instances). This suggests a strong negative correlation between 'D' and the output.
b. Importance of 'D': 85. 'D' seems to have a strong influence on the output, and it's very consistent across instances.
Rank: DCBA

5. Feature 'E':
a. When 'E' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 8 instances). When 'E' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (3 out of 4 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'E' and the output.
b. Importance of 'E': 65. 'E' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAE

6. Feature 'F':
a. When 'F' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 5 instances). When 'F' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 7 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'F' and the output.
b. Importance of 'F': 70. 'F' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'B' and 'E', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAEF

7. Feature 'G':
a. When 'G' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 7 instances). When 'G' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'G' and the output.
b. Importance of 'G': 75. 'G' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'C', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAGEF

8. Feature 'H':
a. When 'H' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (6 out of 8 instances). When 'H' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (2 out of 4 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'H' and the output.
b. Importance of 'H': 65. 'H' seems to have a moderate influence on the output, but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAGEFH

9. Feature 'I':
a. When 'I' increases, the output is more likely to decrease (5 out of 7 instances). When 'I' decreases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'I' and the output.
b. Importance of 'I': 70. 'I' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'B', 'E', and 'F', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAGEFHI

10. Feature 'J':
a. When 'J' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 6 instances). When 'J' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 6 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'J' and the output.
b. Importance of 'J': 70. 'J' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'B', 'E', 'F', and 'I', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAGEFHJI

11. Feature 'K':
a. When 'K' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 7 instances). When 'K' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'K' and the output.
b. Importance of 'K': 75. 'K' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'C' and 'G', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAGEFHJIK

12. Feature 'L':
a. When 'L' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (5 out of 7 instances). When 'L' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 5 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'L' and the output.
b. Importance of 'L': 75. 'L' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'C', 'G', and 'K', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
Rank: DCBAGEFHJIKL

13. Feature 'M':
a. When 'M' increases, the output is more likely to stay the same (4 out of 6 instances). When 'M' decreases, the output is more likely to decrease (4 out of 6 instances). This suggests a negative correlation between 'M' and the output.
b. Importance of 'M': 70. 'M' seems to have a similar influence on the output as 'B', 'E', 'F', 'I', and 'J', but it's not as consistent as 'D'.
